abstract = {This paper targets the problems newcomers face when onboarding to open source projects
and the low retention rate of newcomers. Open source software projects are becoming
increasingly more popular. Many major companies have started building open source
software. Unfortunately, many newcomers only commit once to an open source project
before moving on to another project. Even worse, many novices struggle with joining
open source communities and end up leaving quickly, sometimes before their first successful
contribution. In this paper, we propose a conversational bot that would recommend
projects to newcomers and assist in the onboarding to the open source community. The
bot would be able to provide helpful resources, such as Stack Overflow related content.
It would also be able to recommend human mentors. We believe that this bot would improve
newcomers' experience by providing support not only during their first contribution,
but by acting as an agent to engage them to the project.},

Newcomers are new developers to a software project. The software onboarding process
is more complicated than onboarding into other organizations. It is much more challenging
and time-consuming. The role of a mentor in onboarding newcomers in software engineering
is well understood. However, the disruptions to the work of an experienced developer
can reduce the quality of their work and job satisfaction. We propose a conversational
bot that can help onboard newcomers to a software project instead of an experienced
programmer. The bot will act as a mentor for the newcomer, thus putting less stress
on experienced programmers. The bot will also be able to scan outside sources, such
as stack overflow, for solutions to issues a newcomer may face. The newcomer will
be able to interact with the bot using natural language. We will use this bot to assess
improvements to code quality in future studies.},

abstract = {An important part of software engineering (SE) research is to develop new analysis
techniques and to integrate these techniques into software development practice. However,
since access to developers is non-trivial and research tool adoption is slow, new
analyses are typically evaluated as follows: a prototype tool that embeds the analysis
is implemented, a set of projects is identified, their revisions are selected, and
the tool is run in a controlled environment, rarely involving the developers of the
software. As a result, research artifacts are brittle and it is unclear if an analysis
tool would actually be adopted.In this paper, we envision harnessing the rich interfaces
provided by popular social coding platforms for automated deployment and evaluation
of SE research analysis. We propose that SE analyses can be deployed as analysis bots.
We focus on two specific benefits of such an approach: (1) analysis bots can help
evaluate analysis techniques in a less controlled, and more realistic context, and
(2) analysis bots provide an interface for developers to "subscribe" to new research
techniques without needing to trust the implementation, the developer of the new tool,
or to install the analysis tool locally. We outline basic requirements for an analysis
bots platform, and present research challenges that would need to be resolved for
bots to flourish.},

abstract = {FAQ chatbots possess the capability to provide answers to frequently asked questions
of a particular service, platform, or system. Currently, FAQ chatbot is the most popular
domain of use of dialog assistants. However, developing a chatbot project requires
a full-stack team formed by numerous specialists, such as dialog designer, data scientist,
software engineer, DevOps, business strategist and experts from the domain, which
can be both time and resources consuming. Language processing can be particularly
challenging in languages other than English due to the scarcity of training datasets.Most
of the requirements of FAQ chatbots are similar, domain-specific, and projects could
profit from Open Source Software (OSS) reuse. In this paper, we examine how OSS FAQ
chatbot projects can benefit from reuse at the project level (black-box reuse). We
present an experience report of a FLOSS FAQ chatbot project developed in Portuguese
to an e-government service in Brazil. It comprises of the chatbot distribution service,
as well as for analytics tool integrated and deployed on-premises. We identified assets
that could be reused as a black-box and the assets that should be customized for a
particular application. We categorized these assets in architecture, corpus, dialog
flows, machine learning models, and documentation. This paper discusses how automation,
pre-configuration, and templates can aid newcomers to develop chatbots in Portuguese
without the need for specialized skills required from tools in chatbot architecture.
Our main contribution is to highlight the issues non-English FAQ chatbots projects
will likely face and the assets that can be reused. It allows non-chatbot experts
to develop a quality-assured OSS FAQ chatbot in a shorter project cycle.},

and what benefits and challenges are associated with DevBot usage. In this paper we
report on a mixed-method empirical study of DevBot usage in industrial practice. We
report on findings from interviewing 21 and surveying a total of 111 developers. We
identify three different personas among DevBot users (focusing on autonomy, chat interfaces,
and “smartness”), each with different definitions of what a DevBot is, why developers
use them, and what they struggle with.We conclude that future DevBot research should
situate their work within our framework, to clearly identify what type of bot the
work targets, and what advantages practitioners can expect. Further, we find that
there currently is a lack of general purpose “smart” bots that go beyond simple automation
tools or chat interfaces. This is problematic, as we have seen that such bots, if
available, can have a transformative effect on the projects that use them.},

software engineering process, research shows that developers often face challenges
interacting with these systems. To improve automated developer recommendations from
bots, this work introduces developer recommendation choice architectures. Choice architecture
is a behavioral science concept that suggests the presentation of options impacts
the decisions humans make. To evaluate the impact of framing recommendations for software
engineers, we examine the impact of one choice architecture, actionability, for improving
the design of bot recommendations. We present the results of a preliminary study evaluating
this choice architecture in a bot and provide implications for integrating choice
architecture into the design of future software engineering bots.},

as conduits between users and other tools. Due to their ability to automate tasks,
bots have been widely adopted by Open Source Software (OSS) projects hosted on GitHub.
Commonly, OSS projects use bots to automate a variety of routine tasks to save time
from maintainers and contributors. Although bots can be useful for supporting maintainers'
work, sometimes their comments are seen as spams, and are quickly ignored by contributors.
In fact, the way that these bots interact on pull requests can be disruptive and perceived
as unwelcoming. In this paper, we propose the concept of a meta-bot to deal with current
problems on the human-bot interaction on pull requests. Besides providing additional
value to this interaction, meta-bot will reduce interruptions and help maintainers
and contributors stay aware of important information.},

via a unified software engineering approach a linguistic parser for the understanding
the user's requests, a rational agent for the reasoning about the graphical application,
and a 2D cartoon like agent for the multimodal output. We describe how it has been
applied to three different assistance application contexts, and how it was incrementally
defined via the collection of a corpus of users' requests for assistance. Such an
approach can be useful for the design of other assistance applications since it enables
a clear separation between the original graphical application, its abstract DAFT model
and the linguistic processing of users' requests.},

data-driven methods. To date, recent end-to-end gesture generation methods have not

investigating the effect of different gesturing models in real-time interactions with
different communication modalities, chatbot backends, or different agent appearances.

expertise and technical self-confidence were determined. Technology experienced young

with hyperlink interface or without hyperlinks in the interface. The method to collect,
to automatically analyze and to structure the data according to interaction sequences

abstract = {Building an open-domain conversational agent is a challenging problem. Current evaluation
methods, mostly post-hoc judgments of static conversation, do not capture conversation
quality in a realistic interactive context. In this paper, we investigate interactive
human evaluation and provide evidence for its necessity; we then introduce a novel,
model-agnostic, and dataset-agnostic method to approximate it. In particular, we propose
a self-play scenario where the dialog system talks to itself and we calculate a combination
of proxies such as sentiment and semantic coherence on the conversation trajectory.
We show that this metric is capable of capturing the human-rated quality of a dialog
model better than any automated metric known to-date, achieving a significant Pearson
correlation (r &gt; .7, p &lt; .05). To investigate the strengths of this novel metric and
interactive evaluation in comparison to state-of-the-art metrics and human evaluation
of static conversations, we perform extended experiments with a set of models, including
several that make novel improvements to recent hierarchical dialog generation architectures
through sentiment and semantic knowledge distillation on the utterance level. Finally,
we open-source the interactive evaluation platform we built and the dataset we collected
to allow researchers to efficiently deploy and evaluate dialog models.},

on 100,000 audio samples generated from SimpleCaptcha and can solve new SimpleCaptcha
audio tests in 1.25 seconds on average (with a standard deviation of 0.065 seconds).
Our implementation seems additionally promising because it does not require a powerful
server to function and is robust to adversarial examples that target Deep Speech's
pre-trained models.},

abstract = {The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows information to be exchanged between
a web server and a web browser. C# allows you to program HTTP directly. HTTP programming
allows you to create programs that access the web much like a human user would. These
programs, which are called bots, can collect information or automate common web programming
tasks. This book presents a collection of very reusable recipes for C# bot programming.
This book covers many topics related to C# HTTP programming. Both secure and insecure
HTTP communications are covered, as well as HTTP authentication. Learn to interact
with HTTP forms and support both HTTP POST and HTTP GET requests. Collect data from
a wide array of HTML constructs, such as tables, and lists. Learn about advanced topics
that complicate the life of a bot, such as AJAX and Javascript. Also learn about the
ethical use of bots, and when bots should not be used. This book also introduces the
Heaton Research Spider. The Heaton Research Spider is an open source spider framework.
Using the Heaton Research Spider you can create spiders that will crawl a web site,
much like a real spider crawls the web. The Heaton Research Spider is available in
both Java and Microsoft Dot Net form.}

work made to the project: writing code, reporting bugs, translating, improving documentation,
creating graphics, etc. We are now at the beginning of an exciting era where software
bots will make contributions that are of similar nature than those by humans.Dry contributions,
with no explanation, are often ignored or rejected, because the contribution is not
understandable per se, because they are not put into a larger context, because they
are not grounded on idioms shared by the core community of developers.We have been
operating a program repair bot called Repairnator for 2 years and noticed the problem
of "dry patches": a patch that does not say which bug it fixes, or that does not explain
the effects of the patch on the system. We envision program repair systems that produce
an "explainable bug fix": an integrated package of at least 1) a patch, 2) its explanation
in natural or controlled language, and 3) a highlight of the behavioral difference
with examples.In this paper, we generalize and suggest that software bot contributions
must explainable, that they must be put into the context of the global software development
conversation.},

abstract = {The adoption of refactoring techniques for continuous integration received much less
attention from the research community comparing to root-canal refactoring to fix the
quality issues in the whole system. Several recent empirical studies show that developers,
in practice, are applying refactoring incrementally when they are fixing bugs or adding
new features. There is an urgent need for refactoring tools that can support continuous
integration and some recent development processes such as DevOps that are based on
rapid releases. Furthermore, several studies show that manual refactoring is expensive
and existing automated refactoring tools are challenging to configure and integrate
into the development pipelines with significant disruption cost.In this paper, we
propose, for the first time, an intelligent software refactoring bot, called RefBot.
Integrated into the version control system (e.g. GitHub), our bot continuously monitors
the software repository, and it is triggered by any "open" or "merge" action on pull
requests. The bot analyzes the files changed during that pull request to identify
refactoring opportunities using a set of quality attributes then it will find the
best sequence of refactorings to fix the quality issues if any. The bot recommends
all these refactorings through an automatically generated pull-request. The developer
can review the recommendations and their impacts in a detailed report and select the
code changes that he wants to keep or ignore. After this review, the developer can
close and approve the merge of the bot's pull request. We quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluated the performance and effectiveness of RefBot by a survey conducted with experienced
developers who used the bot on both open source and industry projects.},

has been targeted the most by malware that aim to steal personal information or to
control the users devices. More specifically, mobile botnets are malware that allow
an attacker to remotely control the victims devices through different channels like
HTTP, thus creating malicious networks of bots. In this paper, we show how it is possible
to effectively group mobile botnets families by analyzing the HTTP traffic they generate.
To do so, we create malware clusters by looking at specific statistical information
that are related to the HTTP traffic. This approach also allows us to extract signatures
with which it is possible to precisely detect new malware that belong to the clustered
families. Contrarily to x86 malware, we show that using fine-grained HTTP structural
features do not increase detection performances. Finally, we point out how the HTTP
information flow among mobile bots contains more information when compared to the
one generated by desktop ones, allowing for a more precise detection of mobile threats.},

the complexity of modern software systems in industry and inclusion of modelling topics
in academic curricula, it is no longer a question of whether to use MBSE but how to
use it. Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help
of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers
struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers
to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios
in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and
timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers
in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among
modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore,
an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners
in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and
intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of
a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem
descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations,
particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers. For this domain
modelling bot, we leverage the capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence techniques
such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.},

to API-related questions from API documentation might not be easy because one may
have to manually go through multiple pages before reaching the relevant page, and
then read and understand the information inside the relevant page to figure out the
answers. To deal with this challenge, we develop APIBot, a bot that can answer API
questions given API documentation as an input. APIBot is built on top of SiriusQA,
the QA system from Sirius, a state of the art intelligent personal assistant. To make
SiriusQA work well under software engineering scenario, we make several modifications
over SiriusQA by injecting domain specific knowledge. We evaluate APIBot on 92 API

shows that APIBot can achieve a Hit@5 score of 0.706. },

abstract = {Existing static analysis tools require significant programmer effort. On large code
bases, static analysis tools produce thousands of warnings. It is unrealistic to expect
users to review such a massive list and to manually make changes for each warning.
To address this issue we propose CCBot (short for <bold>C</bold>ode<bold>C</bold>ontracts
<bold>Bot</bold>), a new tool that applies the results of static analysis to existing
code through automatic code transformation. Specifically, CCBot instruments the code
with method preconditions, postconditions, and object invariants which detect faults
at runtime or statically using a static contract checker. The only configuration the
programmer needs to perform is to give CCBot the file paths to code she wants instrumented.
This allows the programmer to adopt contract-based static analysis with little effort.
CCBot's instrumented version of the code is guaranteed to compile if the original
code did. This guarantee means the programmer can deploy or test the instrumented
code immediately without additional manual effort. The inserted contracts can detect
common errors such as null pointer dereferences and out-of-bounds array accesses.
CCBot is a robust large-scale tool with an open-source C# implementation. We have
tested it on real world projects with tens of thousands of lines of code. We discuss
several projects as case studies, highlighting undiscovered bugs found by CCBot, including
22 new contracts that were accepted by the project authors.},

abstract = {Open-content communities that focus on co-creation without requirements for entry
have to face the issue of institutional trust in contributors. This research investigates
the various ways in which these communities manage this issue. It is shown that communities
of open-source software--continue to--rely mainly on hierarchy (reserving write-access
for higher echelons), which substitutes (the need for) trust. Encyclopedic communities,
though, largely avoid this solution. In the particular case of Wikipedia, which is
confronted with persistent vandalism, another arrangement has been pioneered instead.
Trust (i.e. full write-access) is `backgrounded' by means of a permanent mobilization
of Wikipedians to monitor incoming edits. Computational approaches have been developed
for the purpose, yielding both sophisticated monitoring tools that are used by human
patrollers, and bots that operate autonomously. Measures of reputation are also under
investigation within Wikipedia; their incorporation in monitoring efforts, as an indicator
of the trustworthiness of editors, is envisaged. These collective monitoring efforts
are interpreted as focusing on avoiding possible damage being inflicted on Wikipedian
spaces, thereby being allowed to keep the discretionary powers of editing intact for
all users. Further, the essential differences between backgrounding and substituting
trust are elaborated. Finally it is argued that the Wikipedian monitoring of new edits,
especially by its heavy reliance on computational tools, raises a number of moral
questions that need to be answered urgently.},

abstract = {From the end of 2007, the open-source characteristic of Android platform has been
the most competitive one in the smart phone market. According to recent statistics
from Gartner, Android s market share in February 2010 is 3.9%, rises to 17.2% in August
in the same year, and reaches 22.7% in February 2011, which only falls behind Nokia
s by 14.9%. From its skyrocketing growth rate, it can be expected that Google s Android
operating system would become the dominate mobile platform. However, high market share
comes with problems. For instance, in March 2011, Lookout, an information security
company shows Dorid Dream will make the Android phones become the media of Bot Network.
The ever-changing criminal conduct continuously challenges how well the present digital
forensics could react. Data acquisition is an important part in mobile phone forensics.
As the mobile forensic software becomes more mature and popular, most of them are
now facing the same problem where the internal collecting tools must be installed
in the mobile phones first so the data collecting could be started in turn. Whether
this process is against the concept of protecting the original crime scene in forensics
is questionable. A new concept called Live SD is therefore introduced in this work.
It utilizes the concept of data recovery to perform physical data acquisition in Android
smart phones. This data-acquisition methodology differs from the current ones in most
mobile forensics software and can effectively perform the recovery of the deleted
data.},

in the form of code review, static analysis tools like their compiler, or the local

With the advent of social coding sites like GitHub and tight integration of CI services
like Travis CI, software development practices have fundamentally changed. Despite
a highly changed software engineering landscape, however, we still lack a suitable
description of an individual's contemporary software development practices, that is
how an individual code contribution comes to be. Existing descriptions like the v-model
are either too coarse-grained to describe an individual contributor's workflow, or
only regard a sub-part of the development process like Test-Driven Development. In
addition, most existing models are pre- rather than de-scriptive. By contrast, in
our thesis, we perform a series of empirical studies to describe the individual constituents
of Feedback-Driven Development (FDD) and then compile the evidence into an initial
framework on how modern software development works. Our thesis culminates in the finding
that feedback loops are the characterizing criterion of contemporary software development.
Our model is flexible enough to accommodate a broad bandwidth of contemporary workflows,
despite large variances in how projects use and configure parts of FDD.},

communications. Distributed Denial of service attacks pose a serious threat to VOIP
network security. SIP servers are victims of DDos attacks. The major aim of the DDos
attacks is to avoid legitimate users to access resources of SIP servers. Distributed
Denial of service attacks target the VOIP network by deploying bots at different locations
by injecting malformed packets and even they halt the entire VOIP service causes degradation
of QoS(Quality of Service). DDos attacks are easy to launch and quickly drain computational
resources of VOIP network and nodes. Detecting DDos attacks is a challenging and extremely
difficult due to its varying strategy and scope of attackers. Many DDos detection
and prevention schemes are deployed in VOIP networks but they are not complete working
in both realtime and offline modes. They are inefficient in detecting dynamic and
low-rate DDos attacks and even fail when the attack is launched by simultaneously
manipulating multiple SIP attributes. In this paper we propose a novel scheme based
on Hellinger distance(HD) to detect low-rate and multi-attribute DDos attacks. Usually
DDos detection and mitigations schemes are implemented in SIP proxy. But we leverage
the SIP load balancer to fight against DDos by using existing load balancing features.
We have implemented the proposed scheme by modifying leading open source kamailio
SIP proxy server. We have evaluated our scheme by experimental test setup and found
results are outperforming the existing DDos prevention schemes in terms of detection
rate, system overhead and false-positive alarms.},

also contains generic feature generation approaches, as well as methods for generating
tried-and-tested, hand-crafted, domain-specific features. The first chapter defines
the concepts of features and feature engineering, offers an overview of the book,
and provides pointers to topics not covered in this book. The next six chapters are
devoted to feature engineering, including feature generation for specific data types.
The subsequent four chapters cover generic approaches for feature engineering, namely
feature selection, feature transformation based feature engineering, deep learning
based feature engineering, and pattern based feature generation and engineering. The
last three chapters discuss feature engineering for social bot detection, software
management, and Twitter-based applications respectively. This book can be used as
a reference for data analysts, big data scientists, data preprocessing workers, project
managers, project developers, prediction modelers, professors, researchers, graduate
students, and upper level undergraduate students. It can also be used as the primary

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the codependencies of the social and technical
structures that yield Wikipedia the website and Wikipedia the community. In doing
so, the research investigated the implications of such a sociotechnical system for
the maintenance of the project and the emergence of collective intelligence. Using
a theoretical framework informed by digital media studies, science and technology
studies, and the political economy of communication, this study examined the material
and ideological conditions in which Wikipedia has developed. The study's guiding research
questions addressed the nature of Wikipedia's sociotechnical system and potential
for collective intelligence, as well as the historical development of the project's
technical infrastructure and the state of its technology-assisted collaboration. A
mainly qualitative multi-method research approach was employed, including document
analysis, semi-structured interviewing, and social network analysis. A plethora of
documents were carefully selected and examined to explore how and why decisions were
made, policies implemented, and technologies adopted on the site. Additionally, 45
interviews were conducted with members of Wikipedia's technical community to understand
the relationships between social and technical aspects of the project and the motivations
of programmers who contribute automated tools. Finally, social network measures and
visualizations were used to interrogate notions of collaboration and make more transparent
the centrality of technology to the content creation process. The study revealed that
Wikipedia's technical development has been shaped by the dueling ideologies of the
open-source software movement and postindustrial capitalism. Its sociotechnical system
features the complex collaboration of human contributors, automated programs, social
bureaucracy, and technical protocol, each of which conditions the existence and meaning
of the others. In addition, the activity on Wikipedia fits established models of collective
intelligence and suggests the emergence of a cyberculture, or culturally informed
shared intelligence, unique to the digital media context. Software robots (bots) are
central actors in this system and are explored in detail throughout this research.},

abstract = {Optical character recognition (OCR) is one of the fundamental problems in artificial
intelligence and image processing, but recent progress in OCR represents a security
challenge for Web sites that throttle requests with image based CAPTCHAs (Completely
Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart). A CAPTCHA is challenge-response
test placed within web forms to determine whether the user is human. Unfortunately,
algorithms capable of solving image based CAPTCHAs can be used to create spam accounts
and design malicious denial of service (DoS) attacks, causing financial and social
damage. The problem of defeating digital image CAPTCHAs is thus twofold. On the one
hand, it is an important problem in artificial intelligence and image processing.
On the other hand, publicly available CAPTCHAs that are not tested against state of
the art machine recognition algorithms may make the systems vulnerable to attack by
software bots. This paper considers a very important subclass of text CAPTCHAs, those
characterized by salt and pepper noise combined with line (curve) noise. Thus far,
attacks on CAPTCHAs with this type of noise have used relatively simple image processing
methods with some success, but state-of-the-art segmentation methods have not been
fully exploited. In this paper, we propose and benchmark two strong segmentation methods.
The first method is a modification of a multiple quadratic snake proposed for road
extraction from satellite images. The second competing method is a boundary tracing
routine available in the OpenCV open source library. A first numerical experiment
indicates excellent accuracy for both methods. A second experiment on human recognition
shows that the CAPTCHAs used in the study are already near the threshold of being
too hard for humans. Finally, a third numerical experiment presents a more difficult
set of CAPTCHAs with the addition of anti-binarization methods. The snake-based method
is shown to be more resilient to anti-binarization schemes than boundary tracing and
state-of-the art projection-based attacks on CAPTCHAs. Since CAPTCHAs corrupted by
small line noise are shown to be difficult for humans and relatively easy for our
algorithm, CAPTCHA designers should introduce more challenging distortions into their
CAPTCHAs, lest the security of systems based on them be compromised.},

abstract = {It is frequently the case for final degree projects (FDP) to represent the largest
academic endeavor students have been involved with. The writing of the FDP technical
report tends to be one of the hurdles. Due to their inexperience, students fail to
meet quality standards in their writing efforts. Research shows that text and image
plagiarism, poor literature searches and lack of synthesis are some of the most usual
errors. Yet, these error-filled memories keep publishing in university-backed open
repositories. This paper describes a solution to help both students and supervisors
detecting basic quality errors in FDP reports. Based on a chatbot front-end called
Ikastenbot, students can upload their reports while they are writing them and spot,
before publication, possible errors in spelling and grammar, text and images reuse,
and lack of proper referencing. We applied the techniques described on the memories
of our university FDP repository. Results show that Ikastenbot is able to detect errors
in almost every report. The source code of our solution has been published under an
open-source license.},

abstract = {Even though load testing is an established technique to assess load-related quality
properties of software systems, it is applied only seldom and with questionable results.
Indeed, configuring, executing, and interpreting results of a load test require high
effort and expertise. Since chatbots have shown promising results for interactively
supporting complex tasks in various domains (including software engineering), we hypothesize
that chatbots can provide developers suitable support for load testing. In this paper,
we present PerformoBot, our chatbot for configuring and running load tests. In a natural
language conversation, PerformoBot guides developers through the process of properly
specifying the parameters of a load test, which is then automatically executed by
PerformoBot using a state-of-the-art load testing tool. After the execution, PerformoBot
provides developers a report that answers the respective concern. We report on results
of a user study that involved 47 participants, in which we assessed our tool's acceptance
and effectiveness. We found that participants in the study, particularly those with
a lower level of expertise in performance engineering, had a mostly positive view
of PerformoBot.},

abstract = {Background: Some developer activity traditionally performed manually, such as making
code commits, opening, managing, or closing issues is increasingly subject to automation
in many OSS projects. Specifically, such activity is often performed by tools that
react to events or run at specific times. We refer to such automation tools as bots
and, in many software mining scenarios related to developer productivity or code quality,
it is desirable to identify bots in order to separate their actions from actions of
individuals. Aim: Find an automated way of identifying bots and code committed by
these bots, and to characterize the types of bots based on their activity patterns.
Method and Result: We propose BIMAN, a systematic approach to detect bots using author
names, commit messages, files modified by the commit, and projects associated with
the commits. For our test data, the value for AUC-ROC was 0.9. We also characterized
these bots based on the time patterns of their code commits and the types of files
modified, and found that they primarily work with documentation files and web pages,
and these files are most prevalent in HTML and JavaScript ecosystems. We have compiled
a shareable dataset containing detailed information about 461 bots we found (all of
which have more than 1000 commits) and 13,762,430 commits they created.},

abstract = {From the Book: The Internet Web site webopedia.internet.com defines peer-to-peer architecture
as "A type of network in which each workstation has equivalent capabilities and responsibilities.
This differs from client/server architectures, in which some computers are dedicated
to serving the others." But peer-to-peer is much more than a technology; it represents
a radical change in how we will soon use our computers. It is, all at once, a revolution,
an evolution, and a revision. It is a revolution because it turns today's current
client/server architecture on its ear. Suddenly, we're all producers of information
as well as mere consumers. Peer-to-peer computing is also a cultural revolution. Peer-to-peer
technology will fundamentally change the way small groups work and interact over the
Internet. By making it easy to find and download music over the Web, Napster not only
has shown how fragile intellectual property rights of digital material are, but has
probably affected the business model of the major media players, too. It is an evolution
because the current state of software engineering makes possible distributed processing
and storage across personal computers, as well as the first attempts to provide an
operating system for the Internet. It is a revision because, in the early days of
the Internet, peer-to-peer is how all computers were interconnected. The rise of the
Web, with millions of people surfing, engaging in e-commerce, and downloading streaming
video, made client/server architecture a really good idea. About Groove Groove is
an application that uses the Internet to make direct connections between members of
a group. That group can consist offriends, family, co-workers, or any collection of
people who want to communicate, solve problems, or work on a common task. Some of
the functions of Groove let you talk, chat, send instant messages, draw pictures,
share photos and files, play games, and browse the Web with other members of your
group. With Groove, you communicate within secure, shared virtual spaces, in real-time,
or in different places at different times. In addition, Groove is a platform that
allows you to create, deploy, and run your own peer-to-peer applications. At the time
of this writing, Groove runs only on PCs running the Windows operating system. These
are the minimum requirements for installing and running Groove: A 233MHz Pentium processor
or equivalent 64MB of RAM 40MB of available hard disk storage A 56kbps modem (DSL
or cable modem preferred) Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or greater (IE 5.0 or greater
recommended) A sound card, speakers, and microphone, for using the voice features
Updated minimum requirements are posted at www.groove.net/downloads/groove. Who Should
Read This Book This book is intended for those who want to develop peer-to-peer applications
in Groove. The skills required to develop Groove applications include an understanding
of the peer-to-peer paradigm, a working knowledge of extensible Markup Language (XML),
familiarity with Open Software Description (OSD), and the ability to understand programming
in JavaScript. Only the programming skill will be assumedthis book will help the reader
develop the remaining skills. Information on these skills wi presented. The material
is slanted toward intermediate programmers and advanced beginners but should be useful
for advanced programmers with little prior knowledge of the peer-to-peer space. How
the Book Is Structured The following 15 chapters give advanced beginner or intermediate
programmers all the necessary background needed to understand the peer-to-peer paradigm,
the Groove application, Groove architecture, XML, and OSD, as well as the ability
to program and deploy an application on the Groove peer-to-peer platform: Chapter
1, "Why Peer-to-Peer " explores the historical roots of peer-to-peer applications
and discusses why peer-to-peer will be even more important in the future. Peer-to-peer
applications are contrasted with client/server applications, highlighting strengths
and weaknesses for various tasks. Chapter 2, "What Is Groove " touches on the history
of Groovewhy and how it was developed. It describes the product and presents a case
study of its use to solve an actual business problem. The chapter concludes showing
why Groove is particularly useful to intermediate programmers or advanced beginners
wanting to program in the peer-to-peer space. Chapter 3, "Exploring the Groove Application,"
exposes you to the Groove application. Detailed instructions for installing the application
from the CD and a tour of Groove features let readers have the opportunity to experience
peer-to-peer interaction. You will see and use some Groove tools similar to the ones
you will soon be building. In Chapter 4, "Understanding Groove Architecture," you
learn the concept of a shared space and the function of the Groov services that take
care of security, persistence, and dissemination of data are explored so that you'll
understand what services Groove provides. Component services are particularly covered
so that you'll know how versioning and automatic dissemination of Groove toolsincluding
tools you may buildtakes place. Chapter 5, "Essential XML," presents the basics of
XML as they relate to Groove operation and tool development. Chapter 6, "Essential
OSD," explores the concept of Open Software Description. OSD provides an XML-based
vocabulary for describing software packages and their interdependencies. With OSD,
Groove provides the means for extending and updating the Groove application, including
tools like the ones you will develop. Writing OSD is an essential step of tool development
in Groove. Chapter 7, "Creating a Groove Development Environment," assists you in
configuring your machines to easily develop Groove tools without affecting their capability
to use Groove. You will verify that you have the applications you need to program
Groove tools. All necessary applications are either included in system software or
freely downloadable from the Net. Next, you'll learn how to reconfigure Groove to
be able to safely build tools. Finally, we will walk you through the installation
of the Groove Development Kit (GDK) and explore its contents. Chapter 8, "Customizing
Groove," gives you the opportunity to create your own Groove skin. Creating a skin
provides an easy entry into many of the concepts needed to develop Groove tools. In
Chapter 9, "Building a Basic Groove Tool," a short discussion of the steps and elements
neede is followed by a step-by-step tutorial. The tutorial begins the creation of
a peer-to-peer trivia game tool, and addresses User Interface (UI), persistence, and
dissemination issues. This part requires hand-coding of the XML for both understanding
and experience. After an exploration of the tool descriptor, OSD, and .GRV files,
Chapter 10, "Publishing a Basic Groove Tool," is a step-by-step tutorial on publishing
the tool created in the preceding chapter. Chapter 11, "Easier Groove: The Tool Creator
and Tool Publisher," introduces two tools supplied by Groove to make creating and
publishing tools easier. You use these tools to finish the trivia game application.
Chapter 12, "Easier Groove: Modifying the Basic Groove Tool with Tool Creator and
Tool Publisher," is a tutorial that uses Tool Creator and Tool Publisher to modify
and extend the trivia game tool and to republish it. Chapter 13, "Data Integration
and Groove Bots," is a study of data integration in Groove through connectors and
Groove bots. Data integration extends the reach of Groove tools by allowing them to
connect with external information and applications resources. The chapter also covers
some of the features and capabilities of bots and the Groove Enterprise Integration
Server. Chapter 14, "Advanced Topics," continues the ongoing discussion of OSD, particularly
redirection and directory structure strategies, and introduces some of the advanced
features found in Groove. We explore Groove versioning and its implications for writing
tools, and then talk about how to add roles and permissions to your tools, and how
to provide overview and context help. We fin and how they can be used. In Chapter
15, "The Future of Peer-to-Peer," we make some guesses about how peer-to-peer applications
will develop in the years to come, and examine the opportunities that will arise for
peer-to-peer application programmers. If you're ready, let's get started!}

abstract = {A/B testing has become the de facto standard for optimizing design, helping designers
craft more effective user experiences by leveraging data. A typical A/B test involves
dividing user traffic between two experimental conditions (A and B), and looking for
statistically significant differences in performance indicators (e.g., conversion
rates) between them. While this technique is popular, there are other, powerful data-driven
methods --- complementary to A/B testing --- that can tie design choices to desired
outcomes. Mining data from existing designs can expose designers to a greater space
of divergent solutions than A/B testing [1,4] ,RICO:2017. Since companies cannot predict
a priori if the engineering effort for creating alternatives will be commensurate
with a performance increase, they often test small changes, along gradients to local
optima. With the millions of websites and mobile apps available today, it is likely
that almost any UX problem a designer encounters has already been considered and solved
by someone. The challenges are finding relevant existing solutions, measuring their
performance, and correlating these metrics with design features. Recent systems that
capture and aggregate interaction data from third-party Android apps --- with zero
code integration --- open-source analytics that were previously locked away in each
app, allowing designers to test and compare UI/UX patterns found in the wild: [2,3]
2017.Lightweight prototypes with tight user feedback loops, or experimentation engines,
can bootstrap product design involving technologies that are actively being developed
(e.g., artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality), where both use cases and
capabilities are not well-understood [5]. These systems afford staged automation:
initially, "Wizard of Oz'' techniques can scaffold needfinding, and eventually be
replaced with automated solutions informed by the collected data. For example, a chatbot
deployed on social media can serve as an experimentation engine for automating fashion
advice [7]. At first, a pool of personal stylists can power the chatbot to collect
organic conversations revealing common fashion problems, effective interaction patterns
for addressing them, and design considerations for automation. Once technologies are
developed to scale useful interventions [8,9], the chatbot platform provides a testbed
for iteratively refining them. Generative models trained on a set of effective design
examples can support predictive workflows that allow designers to rapidly prototype
new, performant solutions [6]. Models such as generative adversarial networks and
variational autoencoders can produce designs based on high-level constraints, or complete
them given partial specifications. For example, a mobile wireframing tool backed by
such a model could suggest adding "username" and "password" input fields to a screen
with a centrally placed "login" button.},

abstract = {The field of multimedia is dedicated to research and studies that leverage multiple
modalities of signals and data in developing intelligent systems and technologies.
Be it search engine, recommendation system, streaming service, interactive agent,
or collaborative system, multimedia plays a critical role in ensuring full understanding
of multimodal sensory signals, robust modeling of user-content interaction, natural
and rich communication experience, and scalable system deployment. The goal is to
utilize unique contributions from each modality, integrate complementary synergies,
and achieve the best performance and novel functions beyond what's separately available
in each individual medium. In this community, most contributors also maintain strong
activities in other disciplines such as networking, computer vision, human-computer
interaction, and machine learning. But the field of multimedia is unique in offering
a rich and dynamic forum for researchers from "traditional" fields to collaborate
and develop new solutions and knowledge that transcend the boundaries of individual
disciplines.The field enjoys a long history of vibrant research. For example, the
flagship ACM SIGMM Multimedia Conference was established in 1993, celebrating its
25th anniversary this year. The community also has several well-known conferences
and journals organized by ACM, IEEE, and other groups, attracting a large number of
researchers and practitioners from around the world. However, despite the prolific
research activities and outcomes, there has been less effort toward developing books
that serve as an introduction to the rich spectrum of topics in this broad field.
Most of the few books available today either focus on specific subfields or basic
background. There is a lack of tutorial-style materials covering the active topics
being pursued by the leading researchers at frontiers of the field.SIGMM launched
a new initiative to address this need in 2015, by selecting and inviting 12 rising-star
speakers from different subfields of multimedia to deliver plenary tutorial style
talks at ACM Multimedia 2015. Each speaker discussed challenges and the state of the
art within their prospective research areas in a general manner to the broad community.
Topics covered were comprehensive, including multimedia content understanding, multimodal
human-human and human-computer interaction, multimedia social media, and multimedia
system architecture and deployment. Following the very positive responses to the talks,
these rising-star speakers were invited to expand the content covered in their talks
to chapters that can be used as reference materials for researchers, students, and
practitioners. Each resulting chapter discusses problems, technical challenges, state-of-the-art
approaches and performances, open issues, and promising directions for future work.
Collectively, the chapters provide an excellent sampling of major topics addressed
by the community as a whole. This book, capturing outcomes of such efforts, is well
positioned to fill the aforementioned needs by providing tutorial-style reference
materials for frontier topics of multimedia.Section 1 of the book includes five chapters
that are focused on analysis and understanding of multimedia content. Topics covered
range from analysis of video content, audio content, multimodal content about interaction
of freestanding conversational groups, and analysis of multimedia data in the encrypted
format for preserving privacy on cloud servers, to efficient approximate similarity
search techniques for searching over large-scale databases.First, Zuxuan Wu et al.
review current research on understanding video content by detecting the classes of
actions or events contained in a given video clip and generation of full-sentence
captions describing the content in each such video. Unlike previous surveys, this
review focuses on solutions based on deep learning, reflecting the recent trend of
research in this area. The chapter also gives extensive reviews of the datasets used
in state-of-the-art research and benchmarking efforts.Extending the modality from
video to audio, in Chapter 2, Gerald Friedland et al. introduce the field of computer
audition, aiming to develop the theory behind artificial systems that can extract
information from sound. This chapter reviews the research datasets available, appropriate
representations needed for audio, and a few challenging problems such as automatic
extraction of hierarchical semantic structures from audio content and automatic discovery
of high-level semantic concepts from massive audio data and associated metadata.The
holy grail of research for the multimedia community is to be able to integrate and
fuse information extracted from multiple modalities of data. In Chapter 3, Xavier
Alameda-Pineda et al. present an excellent example and emergent research challenges
in the application of detecting social interaction among freestanding conversational
groups. The chapter includes overviews of research issues, approaches, evaluation
of joint estimation of head and body poses using multiPreface modality data (such
as wearable sensors and distributed camera networks), and results of detecting dynamic
group formation of interacting people.Chapter 4 addresses a novel emerging topic prompted
by the popular approach to multimedia analysis using cloud computing servers. When
multimedia data is sent to the cloud for storage or processing, there is a risk of
privacy breach via unauthorized access by third parties to the content in the cloud.
Pradeep Atrey et al. review state-of-the-art methods and open issues for processing
multimedia content in the encrypted domain without needing to convert data to the
original format. This allows content to stay in its protected form while useful analysis
is performed on it.In Chapter 5, Herv\'{e}e Jeundefinedou surveys efficient techniques for finding
approximate solutions for similarity search, which is of particular interest when
searching massive multimedia data like images, videos, and audio recordings. Jeundefinedou
considers various performance factors like query speed, memory requirement, and search
accuracy. Multiple frameworks based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH), quantization/
compression, and hybrid combinations are also reviewed in a coherent manner.In Section
2 of the book, the emphasis shifts from content analysis to humancentered aspects
of multimedia computing. This new focus goes beyond extraction of semantic information
from multimedia data. Instead, the broad research scope incorporates understanding
of users and user-content interaction so as to improve effectiveness of multimedia
systems in many applications, such as search and recommendation.Under the human-centric
theme, Chapter 6, authored by Peng Cui, discusses the evolution of multimedia computing
paradigms from the data-centric, to the content-centric, and recently to the human-centric.
Cui presents a new framework, called social-sensed multimedia computing, to capture
many key issues involved and advances achieved, including understanding of user-content
interaction behavior, understanding of user intent, multimedia representation considering
user intention, and integration of heterogeneous data sensed on multimedia social
networks.Chapter 7 follows the human-centric theme and further moves the focus from
processing individual multimedia data streams to processing a large number of heterogeneous
streams in different modalities involving a large number of people. Analysis of such
massive streams offers the possibility of detecting important situations of society,
such as socio-economic affairs, as well as the living environment. Vivek Singh provides
an overview of the problem definition, research framework, and the EventShop toolkit
he developed for application development in this emerging area.The extension to the
human-centric computing paradigm also calls for formal mathematical theories and tools
for explaining the phenomena observed, such as the information propagation behaviors
and the occurrences of information cascades on social networks. In Chapter 8, Marian-Andrei
Rizoiu et al. review stochastic processes such as the Hawkes point process for modeling
discrete, interdependent events over continuous time. These are strongly related to
patterns corresponding to retweet cascade events on social media. Successful models
like these can help researchers understand information dissemination patterns and
predict popularity on social media.Interaction between users and content reveals not
only the intent of the user (covered in Chapter 6), but also attributes of the content
as well as of the user him/herself. Such interaction can be manifested in multiple
forms including explicit cues such as visual and verbal expressions, and implicit
cues such as eye movement and physiological signals like brain activity and heart
rate. Chapter 9 includes a survey by Subramanian Ramanathan et al. on how such implicit
user interaction cues can be explored to improve analysis of content (scene understanding)
and user (user emotion recognition).To support research and development of emerging
multimedia topics discussed above, there is a critical need for new generations of
communication and computing systems that take into account the unique requirements
of multimedia, such as real-time, high bandwidth, distributiveness, major power consumption,
and resource uncertainty. The popular cloud-based computing systems, though prevalent
formanyapplications, are not suitable for large-scale multimedia applications such
as cloud-based gaming service and animation rendering service.The last section of
the book focuses on the systems aspect, covering distinct topics of multimedia fog
computing (Chapter 10) and cloud gaming (Chapter 11). Cheng-Hsin Hsu et al. survey
the emerging paradigm focused on fog computing, in which computing services are crowdsourced
to the edge nodes or even to the client devices on the user end. This offers major
potential benefits in terms of low latency, location awareness, scalability, and heterogeneity.
However, it also poses many significant challenges in areas such as resource discovery,
resource allocation and management, quality of service, and security. Discussion of
these challenges, along with recent advances in this area, are presented in Chapter
10.Finally, as a concrete example of large-scale distributed multimedia computing
systems, Chapter 11 (by Kuan-Ta Chen et al.) presents a comprehensive survey of cloud
gaming, with emphasis on the development of platform and testbed, test scenarios,
and evaluation of performance, in order to enhance optimal design of various components
of the complex cloud gaming systems. In particular, the chapter overviews extensive
research in areas such as open-source platforms, cloud deployment, client design,
and communication between gaming servers and clients.The scope of this book is by
no means exhaustive or complete. For example, it can be expanded to include other
important topics such as (but not limited to) multimedia content generation, multimodal
knowledge discovery and representation, multimedia immersive networked environments,
and applications in areas like healthcare, learning, and infrastructure. Nonetheless,
the comprehensive survey materials already covered in the book provide an excellent
foundation for exploring additional topics mentioned above, and many other relevant
fields.We would like to give sincere acknowledgment to Dr. Svebor Karaman, who has
provided tremendous assistance in communicating with contributors and organizing the
content of this book. In addition, Diane Cerra and her team at Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers
have provided valuable guidance and editorial help},
