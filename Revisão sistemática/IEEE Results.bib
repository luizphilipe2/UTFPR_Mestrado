abstract={Rising enrollments make it difficult for instructors and teaching assistants to give adequate feedback on each student's work. Our course projects require students to submit GitHub pull requests as deliverables for their open-source software (OSS) projects. We have set up a static code analyzer and a continuous integration service on GitHub to help students check different aspects of the code. However, these tools have some limitations. In this paper, we discuss how we bypass the limitations of existing tools by implementing three Internet bots. These bots are either open source or free for OSS projects and can be easily integrated with any GitHub repositories. One-hundred one Computer Science and Computer Engineering masters students participated in our study. The survey results showed that more than 84% of students thought bots can help them to contribute code with better quality. We analyzed 396 pull requests. Results revealed that bots can provide more timely feedback than teaching staff. The Danger Bot is associated with a significant reduction system-specific guideline violations (by 39%), and the Code Climate Bot is associated with a significant 60% decrease of code smells in student contributions. However, we found that the Travis CI Bot did not help student contributions pass automated tests.},

abstract={In a software project, esp. in open-source, a contribution is a valuable piece of work made to the project: writing code, reporting bugs, translating, improving documentation, creating graphics, etc. We are now at the beginning of an exciting era where software bots will make contributions that are of similar nature than those by humans. Dry contributions, with no explanation, are often ignored or rejected, because the contribution is not understandable per se, because they are not put into a larger context, because they are not grounded on idioms shared by the core community of developers. We have been operating a program repair bot called Repairnator for 2 years and noticed the problem of "dry patches": a patch that does not say which bug it fixes, or that does not explain the effects of the patch on the system. We envision program repair systems that produce an "explainable bug fix": an integrated package of at least 1) a patch, 2) its explanation in natural or controlled language, and 3) a highlight of the behavioral difference with examples. In this paper, we generalize and suggest that software bot contributions must explainable, that they must be put into the context of the global software development conversation.},

abstract={Software bots, which are widely adopted by Open Source Software (OSS) projects, support developers on several activities, including code review. However, as with any new technology adoption, bots may impact group dynamics. Since understanding and anticipating such effects is important for planning and management, we investigate how several activity indicators change after the adoption of a code review bot. We employed a regression discontinuity design on 1,194 software projects from GitHub. Our results indicate that the adoption of code review bots increases the number of monthly merged pull requests, decreases monthly non-merged pull requests, and decreases communication among developers. Practitioners and maintainers may leverage our results to understand, or even predict, bot effects on their projects' social interactions.},

year={2021},
volume={},

pages={6-10},
abstract={As a maintainer of an open source software project, you are usually happy about contributions in the form of pull requests that bring the project a step forward. Past studies have shown that when reviewing a pull request, not only its content is taken into account, but also, for example, the social characteristics of the contributor. Whether a contribution is accepted and how long this takes therefore depends not only on the content of the contribution. What we only have indications for so far, however, is that pull requests from bots may be prioritized lower, even if the bots are explicitly deployed by the development team and are considered useful. One goal of the bot research and development community is to design helpful bots to effectively support software development in a variety of ways. To get closer to this goal, in this GitHub mining study, we examine the measurable differences in how maintainers interact with manually created pull requests from humans compared to those created automatically by bots. About one third of all pull requests on GitHub currently come from bots. While pull requests from humans are accepted and merged in 72.53% of all cases, this applies to only 37.38% of bot pull requests. Furthermore, it takes significantly longer for a bot pull request to be interacted with and for it to be merged, even though they contain fewer changes on average than human pull requests. These results suggest that bots have yet to realize their full potential.},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Since 2018, Thai People Map and Analytics Platform (TPMAP) has been developed with the aims of supporting government officials and policy makers with integrated household and community data to analyze strategic plans, implement policies and decisions to alleviate poverty. However, to acquire complex information from the platform, non-technical users with no database background have to ask a programmer or a data scientist to query data for them. Such a process is time-consuming and might result in inaccurate information retrieved due to miscommunication between non-technical and technical users. In this paper, we have developed a Thai conversational agent on top of TPMAP to support self-service data analytics on complex queries. Users can simply use natural language to fetch information from our chatbot and the query results are presented to users in easy-to-use formats such as statistics and charts. The proposed conversational agent retrieves and transforms natural language queries into query representations with relevant entities, query intentions, and output formats of the query. We employ Rasa, an open-source conversational AI engine, for agent development. The results show that our system yields Fl-score of 0.9747 for intent classification and 0.7163 for entity extraction. The obtained intents and entities are then used for query target information from a graph database. Finally, our system achieves end-to-end performance with accuracies ranging from 57.5%-80.0%, depending on query message complexity. The generated answers are then returned to users through a messaging channel.},

We collected data from 765 OSS projects hosted on GitHub. Our results indicate that most of the studied projects made no more than three modifications in the configurations file, issues tagged as bug reports are exempt from being considered stale, while the same occurs with pull requests that need some input to be processed.},

abstract={Chatbots are envisioned to dramatically change the future of Software Engineering, allowing practitioners to chat and inquire about their software projects and interact with different services using natural language. At the heart of every chatbot is a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component that enables the chatbot to understand natural language input. Recently, many NLU platforms were provided to serve as an off-the-shelf NLU component for chatbots, however, selecting the best NLU for Software Engineering chatbots remains an open challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate four of the most commonly used NLUs, namely IBM Watson, Google Dialogflow, Rasa, and Microsoft LUIS to shed light on which NLU should be used in Software Engineering based chatbots. Specifically, we examine the NLUs' performance in classifying intents, confidence scores stability, and extracting entities. To evaluate the NLUs, we use two datasets that reflect two common tasks performed by Software Engineering practitioners, 1) the task of chatting with the chatbot to ask questions about software repositories 2) the task of asking development questions on Q&A forums (e.g., Stack Overflow). According to our findings, IBM Watson is the best performing NLU when considering the three aspects (intents classification, confidence scores, and entity extraction). However, the results from each individual aspect show that, in intents classification, IBM Watson performs the best with an F1-measure>84%, but in confidence scores, Rasa comes on top with a median confidence score higher than 0.91. Our results also show that all NLUs, except for Dialogflow, generally provide trustable confidence scores. For entity extraction, Microsoft LUIS and IBM Watson outperform other NLUs in the two SE tasks. Our results provide guidance to software engineering practitioners when deciding which NLU to use in their chatbots.},

abstract={Chatbots or conversational agents are computer programs, which interact with users using natural language through artificial intelligence in a way that the user thinks he is having dialogue with a human. One of the main limit of a chatbot technology is associated to the construction of its local knowledge base. A conventional chatbot knowledge base is typically hand constructed, which is a very time-consuming process and may take years to train a chatbot in a particular field of expertise. This work presented in this paper extends the knowledge base of a conventional chatbot beyond its local knowledge base to external knowledge source Wikipedia. This has been achieved by using Media Wiki API to retrieve information from Wikipedia when the chatbot's local knowledge base does not contain the answer to user query. To make the conversation with chatbot more meaningful with regards to the user's previous chat sessions, a user specific session ability has been added to the chatbot architecture. An open source AIML web based chatbot has been modified and programmed for the use in health informatics domain. The chatbot has been named VDMS - Virtual Diabetes Management System. It is intended to be used by the general community and diabetic patients for diabetes education and management.},

abstract={Chatbot (and voicebot) applications are increasingly adopted in various domains such as e-commerce or customer services as a direct communication channel between companies and end-users. Multiple frameworks have been developed to ease their definition and deployment. While these frameworks are efficient to design simple chatbot applications, they still require advanced technical knowledge to define complex interactions and are difficult to evolve along with the company needs (e.g. it is typically impossible to change the NL engine provider). In addition, the deployment of a chatbot application usually requires a deep understanding of the targeted platforms, especially back-end connections, increasing the development and maintenance costs. In this paper, we introduce the Xatkit framework. Xatkit tackles these issues by providing a set of Domain Specific Languages to define chatbots (and voicebots and bots in general) in a platform-independent way. Xatkit also comes with a runtime engine that automatically deploys the chatbot application and manages the defined conversation logic over the platforms of choice. Xatkit's modular architecture facilitates the separate evolution of any of its components. Xatkit is open source and fully available online.},

abstract={Companies and small medium businesses (UMKM) need to interact with customers to increase their customer retention rate. One of the ways is to use chatbot. Aside from being cost-effective, this method is also very effective and very easy for companies to use. To make an easy and effective chatbot requires a combination of two scientific fields, artificial intelligence and software engineering. This study has the following features. 1) Affective sentiment analysis, this feature is inspired by Russel's Circumplex Model. Adjective words will be mapped in a matrix with values based on the Russell Circumplex Model. This model will pay attention on the adjective words, polarity, and affection degree of a sentence. 2) Conjunction sentiment analysis, consider of free way of interaction nowdays, a sentiment analysis system need to determine the sentiment value in multilevel sentences. This multilevel sentence has one or more conjunctions. This conjunction sentiment system will break sentences based on conjunction. The fractional sentence will be processed by affective sentiment analysis. The system then considers the nature of the conjunction to determine the sentiment of the whole sentence. 3) Graph Chatbot, this feature is used to make it easy for companies to modify and generate their bots. This bot will interact with customers like humans, based on a graph chat map that has been created. Chatbot graphs were developed using javascript library Vue js to make it easier to manipulate the visual graph. The system produces satisfying accuracy. Graph chatbot can handle procedural conversations very well. The flow of conversation in accordance with the graph that has been defined. Graph chatbot has 100% accuracy and successfully responds to all user conversations. The sentiment method has 63% accuracy.},

abstract={Internet platforms such as Twitter allow cause-related campaigning as well as analysis through the opportunistic classification and aggregation capability provided by the hashtag (#). South African students leveraged Twitter to launch and sustain a campaign now known as the #FeesMustFall campaign. This campaign aimed to lobby government to provide free university education to disadvantaged students. This study examines the #FeesMustFall campaign to determine if automated software robots played a role. The research question was "Did bots and cyborgs play a role in the #FeesMustFall campaign?" 576 823 tweets were harvested, and the data was cleaned by removing duplicate entries. The remaining 490 449 tweets and 90 783 unique users were used to analyze tweet behavior in terms of frequency, volume, content and tweet source. The results show that bots and cyborgs did indeed play a role. This is a significant finding as #FeesMustFall is the first major South African campaign to leverage bots and cyborgs. An important additional finding was the DeBot API revealed 4 bots not found in our harvested tweets while other trait-driven techniques used identified suspicious accounts which revealed two bot or cyborg accounts ranked 1st and 2nd amongst the highest tweeters. This demonstrated a presence of bots during the campaign that assisted in the amplification of the #FeesMustFall hashtag on Twitter.},

abstract={Chatbot is a new and upcoming technology that has great demand in various industries. The main goal of a chatbot is to create a human-like conversation between a human and a machine, to reduce the work stress. The chatbot can be implemented in any industry easily, unlike any other product where the products need to be developed and tested before switching platforms. In colleges, especially during the time of admission, reception gets crowded and people have to wait to get their queries solved. If any person wants to know about the college, then he/she has to travel to college. Although every college has its website, not everybody can find the answer to their query. Colleges are not working on weekends, so if someone wants to visit or call reception to get their query answered they will have to wait until any working weekday. To solve these problems, we will create an AI chatbot. This chatbot will be embedded on the college website and will be able to answer any college-related query easily. Chabot will be able to answer multiple persons at the same time, people don't have to visit the college to get their query solved and it will be available 24/7.},

abstract={A Conversational Agent (CA), or dialogue system, is a computer system that has the ability to respond to humans automatically using natural language. CAs offer instant responses and can concurrently assist a potentially unlimited number of users. The modeling of CAs in Arabic has so far received less attention when compared with other languages due to the complexity of the Arabic language, the existence of several dialects, and a lack of data resources. The literature contends that modeling a CA in Arabic mostly done using pattern-matching and information retrieval, employing classification approaches with a closed-domain data source. There is extremely limited research so far on modeling an open-domain CA in the Arabic dialect. This research has utilized a deep-learning architecture, known as the Seq2Seq neural network, to build a CA in the Arabic Gulf dialect. We formulated the CA problem as a machine translation problem and, therefore, built our corpus from tweets, in the post-reply format, to train and evaluate the model. We investigated the effects of pretrained embeddings on the performance of the CA. For our evaluation, a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score and human evaluators were used. The performance of the model was found to be comparable with existing deep learning models that have been trained on much larger corpora and in other languages. Our results present a promising first step towards building an open-domain CA in the Gulf Arabic dialect.},

abstract={Dialogue Systems are increasingly popular with the recent advances in neural approaches and NLP applied to conversational AI. Alexa, Siri, Cortana, Google Mini are handily used by many users to do small tasks and control their home appliances in hands free style. Enterprises are also deploying 24 × 7 dialogue agent in place of traditional customer support to increase user engagement and improve their processes. Dialogue Systems are also augmented with Robots to improve human-robot dialogues.Conversational Agents are classified into two main types: Social bots/Chitchat bots and Task Oriented Dialogue Agents. Social bots aim to engage user with unstructured human conversations. These dialogue agents don't have fixed aim to complete and focus more on carrying out open domain conversations. For example ALIZA, Microsoft XiaoIce etcOn the other hand, Task oriented dialogue agents help user to accomplish certain tasks in specific domains like Restaurant booking, Flight reservation, customer support etc. These are popularly used in controlling home appliances and carrying out simple tasks by users in day to day life. Siri, Alexa, Google Mini, Cortana are task oriented dialogue agents. There is increasing interest in building task completion dialogue agents that span over multiple sub-domains to accomplish a complex user goal.With the increasing acceptance of Dialogue Agents, there is need of high-quality, large-scale dialogue datasets for better performance of task oriented dialogue agent in changing environment. Neural approaches are applied to design intelligent dialogue agents frequently which require very large datasets. However, there are following challenges while building intelligent task completion dialogue systems. Firstly, there are a lot of datasets available for chit-chat bots but they are not directly relevant to task oriented systems. Secondly, to scale out the system to new domains with limited in-domain data.In this paper, we studied different data collection methods, important characteristics of dialogue datasets and their potential uses. This paper presents a survey of publicly available datasets and their applicability for designing modern task - oriented dialogue agents.},

The Repairnator bot is an autonomous agent that constantly monitors test failures, reproduces bugs, and runs program repair tools against each reproduced bug. If a patch is found, Repairnator bot reports it to the developers. At the time of writing, Repairnator uses three different program repair systems and has been operating since February 2017. In total, it has studied 11 523 test failures over 1 609 open-source software projects hosted on GitHub, and has generated patches for 15 different bugs. Over months, we hit a number of hard technical challenges and had to make various design and engineering decisions. This gives us a unique experience in this area. In this paper, we reflect upon Repairnator in order to share this knowledge with the automatic program repair community.},

year={2019},

pages={152-162},
abstract={The documentation of code changes is significantly important but developers ignore it, most of the time, due to the pressure of the deadlines. While developers may document the most important features modification or bugs fixing, recent empirical studies show that the documentation of quality improvements and/or refactoring is often omitted or not accurately described. However, the automated or semi-automated documentation of refactorings has not been yet explored despite the extensive work on the remaining steps of refactoring including the detection, prioritization and recommendation. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated refactoring documentation bot that helps developers to interactively check and validate the documentation of the refactorings and/or quality improvements at the file level for each opened pull-request before being reviewed or merged to the master. The bot starts by checking the pullrequest if there are significant quality changes and refactorings at the file level and whether they are documented by the developer. Then, it checks the validity of the developers description of the refactorings, if any. Based on that analysis, the documentation bot will recommend a message to document the refactorings, their locations and the quality improvement for that pull-request when missing information is found. Then, the developer can modify his pull request description by interacting with the bot to accept/modify/reject part of the proposed documentation. Since refactoring do not happen in isolation most of the time, the bot is documenting the impact of a sequence of refactorings, in a pull-request, on quality and not each refactoring in isolation. We conducted a human survey with 14 active developers to manually evaluate the relevance and the correctness of our tool on different pull requests of 5 open source projects and one industrial system. The results show that the participants found that our bot facilitates the documentation of their quality-related changes and refactorings.},

abstract={The interaction between instructors and students is one of the key concepts to improve the student's learning process. To personalize learning on a massive scale, social bots can be used as supporting technology. However, their development for virtual learning environments currently requires deep technical knowledge. This leaves learner communities relying on highly-skilled developers to generate and tailor these social bots. Participatory design, end-user development and model-driven principles bear the potential to close this technical gap. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for creating social bots. Using our framework, learners can create, train and utilize these for self-hosted virtual learning environments relying on OpenAPI specifications offered, e.g. by Blackboard. We support both retrieval-based bots that react to certain events in predefined ways, as well as generative bots by utilizing open source deep learning technologies. Our first evaluation shows the usefulness of model-driven generation and utilization of social bots. We see the potential of this approach to move the development closer to the actual learner.},

abstract={Micro-blogging sites such as Twitter, with 187 million active users daily, have become an essential source for getting news and trends, sharing information, and gathering various insights. Many user accounts on Twitter are automated with software to share content automatically without human intervention. Such accounts are called bots. However, the open nature of Twitter has resulted in people misusing it for changing the information dynamics, as seen in the US 2016 elections. This research proposes a neural network ensemble of Text CNN and LSTM model with BERT embeddings to classify tweets as bot tweets or not based on the tweets' textual content. Along with this, we handle the problem of data imbalance present in the Twitter dataset, using the Language Model Oversampling Technique to create a bot language model that will mimic bot tweets over the traditional techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling technique. A comparison and analysis of the tweets generated by the above two methods is made. The comparison with the various state-of-the-art model shows that the proposed model outperforms the previous models.},

abstract={The abundance of information regarding the most of domains makes Internet the best resource. Besides its usefulness, it is however difficult to automate the process of information extraction due to lack of structure in online information. The most commonly used information sharing protocol Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) makes it possible to embed a lot of noise (like advertisements, images, headers, menus, etc.) in a document containing the useful information. Thus the filtering of noise prior information extraction is necessary. Such filtering of noise has many applications, including cell phone and Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) browsing, speech rendering for visually impaired or blind people, open source intelligence and many others. In this paper, we describe a statistical model to filter such noise from a document containing useful information. Our model is based on strategies to analyse the text distribution and link densities in HTML page across all of the nodes of Document Object Model (DOM) tree for detection of useful nodes among them. We describe the validity of model with the help of experiment conducted in implementation of an Early Warning System to facilitate open source intelligence. We also present the general work flow to convert the unstructured online text about terrorists into investigate-able data structure for social network analysis and discuss how our model fits into it.},

abstract={Software engineering is an intrinsically collaborative activity, especially in the era of Agile Software Development. Many actors are partaking in development activities, such that a common understanding should be reached at numerous stages during the overall development life-cycle. For a few years now, Natural Language Processing techniques have been employed either to extract key information from free-form text or to generate models from the analysis of text in order to ease the sharing of knowledge across all parties. A significant part of these approaches focuses on retrieving lost domain and architectural knowledge through the analysis of documents, issue management systems or other forms of knowledge management systems. However, these post-processing methods are time-consuming by nature since they require to invest significant resources into the validation of the extracted knowledge. In this paper, inspired by collaborative tools, bots and Natural Language extraction approaches, we envision new ways to collaboratively record and document design decisions as they are discussed. These decisions will be documented as they are taken and, for some of them, static or behavioural models may be generated on-the-fly. Such an interactive process will ensure everyone agrees on critical design aspects of the software. We believe development teams will benefit from this approach because manual encoding of design knowledge will be reduced and will not be pushed to a later stage, when not forgotten.},

abstract={Chatbot is a software application that can stimulate a conversation via text, instead of direct contact with a live human through messaging applications, websites and mobile applications. Chatbot applications help to make interactions between people and services by enhancing the customer experience. Chatbot is widely used in the areas of food ordering, ecommerce and transportation, etc. Practically it is not possible to find a permanent companion to make us happy all the time. Hence, this paper has planned to design a jollity chatbot to talk with the human users and make sure that it entertains and give suggestion and motivation in tough times. The jollity chatbot is implemented in Rasa, an open -source conversational AI framework and it is easy to customize. The proposed method has added 12 intents with each more than 8 text examples constituting a total of 100 input samples in nlu.md and their response in domain.yml. The flow of interactions is given in stories.md. The jollity chatbot is deployed in Telegram using ngrok and the server URL details and the access token are given in the credentials.yml. The system is experimented with various evaluation measures like accuracy of the intents, accuracy of the stories and the confusion matrix to shows that the proposed jollity chatbot system is more robust and can identify the user intents appropriately.},

abstract={To help meet the growing needs of the robotics community, the Robot Operating System (ROS) is currently undergoing a major redesign in which one of its primary design goals is to prioritize support for real-time computing (ROS2). Real-time computing techniques are found in most industrial robots, and yet this capability is noticeably lacking from many of the open-source ROS robots in existence today. This knowledge gap is problematic for students using ROS and their future employers with realtime systems requiring development and maintenance. Bobble-Bot is an open-source ROS robot that was created to close this gap. The robot demonstrates the use of real-time control using ROS in a fun and engaging way. Bobble-Bot is a modern example of the classic inverted pendulum problem that is commonly covered in control theory. It is a controls problem that requires a real-time controller to maintain stability. This paper introduces Bobble-Bot and its accompanying simulator in order to demonstrate how to design a real-time system that uses the ROS and ROS2 frameworks. In addition, results from simulation and hardware tests are provided along with links to Bobble-Bot's open-source software and project documentation.},

abstract={Experimentation in a large-scale testbed environment requires a large amount of emulated traffic to ensure realistic scenario execution and better experiment results. A large number of human-generated network activities can emulate traffic from real network users. Deploying and producing a single activity from an individual user is simple, but emulating and automating it from multiple users with a wide range of activities is challenging. We designed a containerized human agent (i.e., bot) to generate a single activity. Thus, a large number of bots can be deployed and controlled by a single orchestration system. Due to the complexity and wide-range usage of container orchestration systems, we need to develop a simpler system that leverages widely-used open-source container orchestrator. So, researchers and scientists can easily use it to define and execute activity requirements with a few command lines or a single specification file. This work shows the implementation of an orchestration system with several unique bots and their deployment in a production testbed environment. Several activity use cases are also presented to verify their functionality to support large-scale experimentation.},

abstract={The adoption of refactoring techniques for continuous integration received much less attention from the research community comparing to root-canal refactoring to fix the quality issues in the whole system. Several recent empirical studies show that developers, in practice, are applying refactoring incrementally when they are fixing bugs or adding new features. There is an urgent need for refactoring tools that can support continuous integration and some recent development processes such as DevOps that are based on rapid releases. Furthermore, several studies show that manual refactoring is expensive and existing automated refactoring tools are challenging to configure and integrate into the development pipelines with significant disruption cost. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, an intelligent software refactoring bot, called RefBot. Integrated into the version control system (e.g. GitHub), our bot continuously monitors the software repository, and it is triggered by any "open" or "merge" action on pull requests. The bot analyzes the files changed during that pull request to identify refactoring opportunities using a set of quality attributes then it will find the best sequence of refactorings to fix the quality issues if any. The bot recommends all these refactorings through an automatically generated pull-request. The developer can review the recommendations and their impacts in a detailed report and select the code changes that he wants to keep or ignore. After this review, the developer can close and approve the merge of the bot's pull request. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the performance and effectiveness of RefBot by a survey conducted with experienced developers who used the bot on both open source and industry projects.},

abstract={The systems and software engineering disciplines are continuing to mature while information technology advances. This International Standard was prepared to collect and standardize terminology. Its purpose is to identify terms currently in use in the field and standard definitions for these terms. It is intended to serve as a useful reference for those in the Information Technology field, and to encourage the use of systems and software engineering standards prepared by ISO and liaison organizations IEEE Computer Society and Project Management Institute (PMI). This International Standard replaces IEEE Std 610.12-1990, IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology, which was contributed by the IEEE as a source document. The approach and lexical exactitude of IEEE Std 610.12-1990 served as a model for this International Standard. Nevertheless, approximately two thirds of the definitions in this International Standard are new since IEEE Std 610.12 was last updated in 1990, a reflection of the continued evolution in the field.},

abstract={Botnets are emerging as the most serious cyber threat among different forms of malware. Today botnets have been facilitating to launch many cybercriminal activities like DDoS, click fraud, phishing attacks etc. The main purpose of botnet is to perform massive financial threat. Many large organizations, banks and social networks became the target of bot masters. Botnets can also be leased to motivate the cybercriminal activities. Recently several researches and many efforts have been carried out to detect bot, C&C channels and bot masters. Ultimately bot maters also strengthen their activities through sophisticated techniques. Many botnet detection techniques are based on payload analysis. Most of these techniques are inefficient for encrypted C&C channels. In this paper we explore different categories of botnet and propose a detection methodology to classify bot host from the normal host by analyzing traffic flow characteristics based on time intervals instead of payload inspection. Due to that it is possible to detect botnet activity even encrypted C&C channels are used.},

The user is distant from the device and thus the speech signal entering the device may be subject to reverberation and may be disturbed by background noise. The proposed structure consists of a microphone array which allows for techniques of directional processing. Thus it is able to enhance a desired speech source and suppress other speech sources in the background. Three different optimal beamforming methods are considered in a real world car hands-free environment: an optimal near-field array gain optimization procedure, a theoretical diffuse noise field model for a point source and a least squares solution.},

abstract={An incremental parsing algorithm based on dynamic programming techniques is described. The analyzer takes the automaton generated from a general class of context-free grammars as driver, and any finite string as input. Given an input string that has been modified, the algorithm cuts out the parts of the old analysis that had been generated by the parts of the input that has changed. What remains are the parts of the analysis that were generated by the stable part of the input. The new system has been baptized ICE, after Incremental Context-Free Environment. In an empirical comparison, ICE appears to be superior to the other context-free analyzers and comparable to standard deterministic parsers, when the input string is not ambiguous.<>},

abstract={To simulate a realistic game server environment, we utilized open source software libraries to create automated players (bots) for the globally renowned online game: Minecraft. The fairly simple design of the Minecraft server as well as its massive development and support community facilitates considerable research and analysis prospects. As such, the goal of our investigation was to emulate and then analyze the real-world stress that game-players actively create on hosting servers. We achieved this through creating scripted movements of Minecraft characters that are connected to the Minecraft server(s) hosted within our virtual infrastructure. After this was achieved, we explored altering the methods of running the active Minecraft servers to control CPU load; we primarily explored manually setting the CPU affinity of the Minecraft server thread to run on specific virtual cores. Collecting CPU workload data while the bots were running around on our servers gave us consistent and predictable readings that confirmed the success of our methods we used to control performance. Evidence of this is illustrated through the use of graphs and other experimental data outlined in the body of this document.},

abstract={The advances in natural language processing and the wide use of social networks have boosted the proliferation of chatbots. These are software services typically embedded within a social network, and which can be addressed using conversation through natural language. Many chatbots exist with different purposes, e.g., to book all kind of services, to automate software engineering tasks, or for customer support. In previous work, we proposed the use of chatbots for domain-specific modelling within social networks. In this short paper, we report on the needs for flexible modelling required by modelling using conversation. In particular, we propose a process of meta-model relaxation to make modelling more flexible, followed by correction steps to make the model conforming to its meta-model. The paper shows how this process is integrated within our conversational modelling framework, and illustrates the approach with an example.},

Modular and adjustable finger designs are provided, giving the user a range of options depending on the intended use of the hand. The design tradeoffs and decisions made to achieve the 3D-printable, compact and lightweight robotic gripper are discussed, as well as a preliminary discussion of the performance differences between the finger designs.

abstract={Along with more and more use of thin-profile fine-pitch ball grid array (TFBGA) in portable electronic products, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistant (PDA), etc., the drop impact reliability of solder joints for TFBGA becomes a critical concern. This problem is more serious with the application of lead free solder because lead free solder alloy have higher rigidity and lower ductibility compared with the traditional SnPb solder alloy. Whereas the drop test is high cost and long cycle, and the traditional board level drop simulation poses severe challenge to the computer resource, the theory analysis and modal superposition method are combined in this paper. Firstly, the drop vibration differential equation of simplified PCB assembly is deduced and the analytic solution is solved based on the given boundary condition according to the dynamics theory. Secondly, the ANSYS/LS-DYNA software is employed, a quarter 3D model with 15 representatives lead free TFBGA mounted on PCB is developed, and the dynamic responses of solder joint is analyzed under the drop impact. The critical solder joint with the maximal stress caused by deflection of PCB is identified by the model. Finally, the relationship between the number of screws which support the PCB and the PCB deflection under drop impact is studied through the modal superposition, and the influence of every stage mode to the PCB bending deflection is discussed. The results show that the outermost corner solder joint called critical solder joint is aptest to failure. More deflection of PCB causes larger stress of solder joint. The first bend mode is the main factor which influences the bending deflection of PCB. Adopting more screws to support PCB as well as reducing the influence of the first mode is good to improve the drop impact performance of solder joint. Compared with time history explicit dynamic analysis, modal superposition harmonic response analysis can save the solving time greatly.},

In this paper, we explore using bots to improve the software engineering behaviors of students using developer recommendation choice architectures, a framework incorporating behavioral science concepts in recommendations to improve the actions of programmers. We implemented this framework in class-bot, a novel system designed to nudge students to make better choices while working on programming assignments.

abstract={Software engineers typically rely on mental models of their project and peers for project-specific insights important to their work. Ever expanding software size and complexity makes it strenuous to maintain such mental models and leads to subjectivity. At the same time, consistent peer interactions lead to interrupts, thereby hampering productivity. Moreover, due to client mandates, typical project environments employ a plethora of heterogeneous tools, thus making the information retrieval process fairly complex. We believe that 'digital coworkers' leveraging Human-AI collaboration, have huge potential here to help out with such challenges.

An increasingly common form of transmitted data is a computer program description. This paper examines the compression of source code, the high-level language representation of a program, using the language's context free grammar. We call the general technique guided parsing since it is a compression scheme based on predicting the behavior of a parser when it parses the source code and guiding its behavior by encoding its next action based on this prediction. In this paper, we describe the implementation and results of two very different forms of guided parsing. One is based on bottom-up parsing while the other is a top-down approach.},

abstract={Introduction: Although the interview is the most important and widely used requirements elicitation technique, novice engineers do not receive adequate training in Requirements Engineering (RE) courses. Objectives: Develop an AI-based interview simulator for helping novice requirements engineers in gaining interview skills. Methods: The research is based on the Design Science Methodology for Information Systems. The simulator is the outcome of six cycles; in each cycle, a proof of concept with additional features is created. Each cycle finishes with evaluation and improvement suggestions. Results: The simulator has been tested with students and results have been promising. The interview simulator understands context-free questions, retrieving the right information related to RE concepts such as goals, tasks, users, benefits, and constraints. The simulator also answers questions based on the context, makes summaries of the conversation, responds to meta-questions, and adds ambiguity and incompleteness to the conversation. Conclusions: The results have been promising. The simulator has been tested with degree and master level students. They were able to create a requirements specification using the simulator, and the feedback has been generally positive. The simulator will be tested in a real RE course in the academic year 2020-2021. Once it proves effective in the classroom, it will be opened to the RE community for free use and improvement.},

abstract={Handheld computing devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and the latest mobile phones are becoming widespread, so migrating desktop applications to these platforms is of great interest to developers. However, little information is available to guide the novice especially for the palm OS, the,most popular platform in the PDA and smartphone arena. This paper highlights the migration challenges involved and potential directions in easing this reengineering process. To explore the practical understanding and reengineering issues, a large legacy application was partially migrated to palm OS.},

abstract={A smartphone is a newcomer that has the ability of personal digital assistants (PDA) with the small appearance of cellular telephones. Although a PDA phone, which is a PDA with a CDMA or GSM module, has bigger appearance, a smartphone is a small device, which looks like a cellular telephone with PDA ability. Most smartphones have adopted Smartphone2002, Smartphone2003 or embedded Linux. Smartphone2002 and Smartphone2003 made by Microsoft have great capability, performance and conveniences. But they are not license-free. Embedded Linux is license-free and gives good opportunity for users and developers to modify it. But most smartphones adopting embedded Linux have PDA appearance. In addition, the graphical user interface (GUI) such as GTK is not proper for the cellular telephone size. In this paper, a smartphone system based on Linux and GTK+2 is proposed. The smartphone system is license-free and small like cellular telephone systems. It supports one-handed operation using keys or touch screen. To adopt Linux as the OS of the smartphone, ETRI's QPlus-P kernel is used. To adopt GTK+2 as the GUI system of the smartphone, GTK+2 is modified to support one-handed operation without touch screen or stylus.},

abstract={The Victoria and Albert Museum is tucked away in London's South Kensington district, nestled between the glittery lights of Harrods and Knightsbridge on one side and the solemn edifice of the Royal Albert Hall on the other. The area between the museum and the Royal Albert Hall makes up the Albertopolis, an area brought to life in the mid-nineteenth century by a huge wave of investment from Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, following a hugely successful public exhibition (called, imaginatively, the Great Exhibition) that was held in nearby Hyde Park. The profits from the Great Exhibition were set aside for huge investment into this area of London that is now bustling with landmarks, such as the Science Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Royal Albert Hall and Victoria and Albert Museum, the Royal Colleges of Art and Music, Imperial College, and more. All the museums in Albertopolis are free to enter, and the Royal Albert Hall runs countless free or inexpensive events, while Imperial College runs an annual science festival to showcase their research for the public. This is a part of London where art and technology collide with the public in the nicest of ways, so where better to meet and talk about Twitterbots? In April 2016 the Bot Summit, an annual day of talks and thinking about bots, came to Europe for the first time, hosted by the Victoria and Albert Museum.1 The event attracted bot makers from all over the United Kingdom and many from overseas, thanks to a fundraising effort by the bot community to bring speakers from abroad. Any who couldn't make it in person were able to tune in to a live stream, which you can still find and watch online. Its organizer, bot builder Darius Kazemi, was there in person to coordinate the day, at the center of a melting pot for culture and science.},

pages={35-38},
abstract={An important part of software engineering (SE) research is to develop new analysis techniques and to integrate these techniques into software development practice. However, since access to developers is non-trivial and research tool adoption is slow, new analyses are typically evaluated as follows: a prototype tool that embeds the analysis is implemented, a set of projects is identified, their revisions are selected, and the tool is run in a controlled environment, rarely involving the developers of the software. As a result, research artifacts are brittle and it is unclear if an analysis tool would actually be adopted. In this paper, we envision harnessing the rich interfaces provided by popular social coding platforms for automated deployment and evaluation of SE research analysis. We propose that SE analyses can be deployed as analysis bots. We focus on two specific benefits of such an approach: (1) analysis bots can help evaluate analysis techniques in a less controlled, and more realistic context, and (2) analysis bots provide an interface for developers to "subscribe" to new research techniques without needing to trust the implementation, the developer of the new tool, or to install the analysis tool locally. We outline basic requirements for an analysis bots platform, and present research challenges that would need to be resolved for bots to flourish.},

abstract={The tracking and timely resolution of service requests is one of the major challenges in agile project management. Having an efficient solution to this problem is a key requirement for Walmart to facilitate seamless collaboration across its different business units. The Jira software is one of the popular choices in industries for monitoring such service requests. A service request once logged into the system by a reporter is referred to as a (Jira) ticket which is assigned to an engineer for servicing. In this work, we explore how the tickets which may arise in any of the Walmart stores and offices distributed over several countries can be assigned to engineers efficiently. Specifically, we will discuss how the introduction of a bot for automated ticket assignment has helped in reducing the disparity in ticket assignment to engineers by human managers and also decreased the average ticket resolution time- thereby improving the experience for both the reporters and the engineers. Additionally, the bot sends reminders and status updates over different business communication platforms for timely tracking of tickets; it can be suitably modified to provision for human intervention in case of special needs by some teams. The current study conducted over data collected from various teams within Walmart shows the efficacy of our bot.},

abstract={Web bots, such as XRumer, Magic Submitter and SENuke, have been widely used by attackers to perform illicit activities, such as massively registering accounts, sending spam, and automating web-based games. Although the technique of CAPTCHA has been widely used to defend against web bots, it requires users to solve some explicit challenges, which is typically interactive and intrusive, resulting in decreased usability. In this paper, we design a novel, non-intrusive moving-target defense system, NOMAD, to complement existing solutions. NOMAD prevents web bots from automating web resource access by randomizing HTML elements while not affecting normal users. Specifically, to prevent web bots uniquely identifying HTML elements for later automation, NOMAD randomizes name/id parameter values of HTML elements in each HTTP form page. We evaluate NOMAD against five powerful state-of-the-art web bots on several popular open source web platforms. According to our evaluation, NOMAD can prevent all these web bots with a relatively low overhead.},

This work is part of the iMASH project, a multi-year, multi-discipline collaborative effort focused on enabling mobile client platforms and incorporating them into existing legacy networked systems for use by medical practitioners. We have developed a tiered architecture that includes a middleware server layer positioned between existing application servers and multiple clients to make session transfer transparent to the user. Any client application executing our middleware-aware remote code library can save and restore its session by interacting with a middleware server. As a proof of concept, we have implemented the transfer of bookmarks, history, Web cache, and user preferences with the Mozilla open source Web browser, from this effort we have established baseline performance metrics and have found that the overhead is within reasonable bounds of just a few seconds of latency.},

abstract={Many chatbots have been developed that provide a multitude of services through a wide range of methods. A chatbot is a brand-new conversational agent in the highspeed changing technology world. With the advance of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, chatbots are becoming more and more popular. A chatbot is the extension of human interface mediums such as the phone and social platforms. Similarly, Cryptocurrency is a new extension of digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. In the current digital exchanging world, investors and interested parties are eager to know more information about, and the capabilities of, this new type of currency. One of the potential paths to retrieve the info automatically and quickly is through a chatbot. We explored the open source python library, Chatterbot, to apply Itchat API (a WeChat interface) with the aim of building a robot chatting application, I&C Chat, on the topic of cryptocurrency. First, we collected question and answer pairs datasets from Quora websites. Furthermore, we also created API calls to query the real time quote for the top 25 cryptocurrencies. Then we used the collected data to train our chatbot and implemented a logic adapter to receive the price quote of cryptocurrencies based on the incoming question. The Itchat API method will return the best matched answer to the asking party automatically. The response time of different questions has been investigated. The results imply that this application is quite useful, feasible and beneficial to the digital currency world.},

Using the data from depth camera, people are identified by approximating a person's skeletal information. Based on the movements of the individual, the program tracks a human body, or bodies, within the camera's field of view. Joint locations, in the tracked human, are isolated for specific usage by the program. Joints include the head, torso, shoulders, elbows, hands, knees and feet. The dragon capabilities include a four degrees-of-freedom neck, moving wings, tail, jaw, blinking eyes and sound effects. These outputs instigate a movement in the tracked human, which establishes the cycle of human to animatronic interactions. This animatronic creature design will allow for future research in the effectiveness of interactive elements in themed environments.},

abstract={Addition of Al into SAC alloys reduces the number of hard Ag3Sn and Cu6Sn5 IMC particles, and forms larger, softer non-stoichiometric AlAg and AlCu particles. This results in a significant reduction in yield strength, and also causes some moderate increase in creep rate. For high Ag SAC alloys, adding Al 0.1-0.6% to SAC alloys is most effective in softening, and brings the yield strength down to the level of SAC105 and SAC1505, while the creep rate is still maintained at SAC305 level. Addition of Ni results in formation of large (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 IMC particles and loss of Cu3Sn4 particles. This also causes softening of SAC alloys, although to a less extent than that of Al addition. Addition of Al also drives the microstructure to shift from near-ternary SnAgCu eutectic toward combination of eutectic SnAg and eutectic SnCu. Addition of Ni drives shifting toward eutectic SnAg. For SAC+Al+Ni alloys, the pasty range and liquidus temperature are about 4degC less than that of SAC 105 or SAC 1505 if the addition quantity is less than about 0.6%. Addition of Al and Ni also results in a slight decrease in modulus and elongation at break, although the tensile strength is not affected.},

abstract={Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology to develop software bots that automate repetitive sequences of interactions between users and software applications (a.k. a. routines). To take full advantage of this technology, organizations need to identify and to scope their routines. This is a challenging endeavor in large organizations, as routines are usually not concentrated in a handful of processes, but rather scattered across the process landscape. Accordingly, the identification of routines from User Interaction (UI) logs has received significant attention. Existing approaches to this problem assume that the UI log is segmented, meaning that it consists of traces of a task that is presupposed to contain one or more routines. However, a UI log usually takes the form of a single unsegmented sequence of events. This paper presents an approach to discover candidate routines from unsegmented UI logs in the presence of noise, i.e. events within or between routine instances that do not belong to any routine. The approach is implemented as an open-source tool and evaluated using synthetic and real-life UI logs.},

abstract={Home or Office Automation may be described as a system to provide ease of operation of connected devices or appliances. Most commercial environments, during active hours, consume large amounts of energy resources; this could be optimized to the minimum by smartly monitoring and managing the resources. IoT (Internet of Things) enables this to be a possible solution at reasonable cost factors. However, it is important to note that in commercial environments, security is a key factor; corporations cannot depend on opening up their networks to the outside world in order to avail the services offered by currently available smart-devices. Localizing and privatizing the entire automation and control system would be desirable for such domains. The work presented in this paper proposes a solution for such applications which is crucial for the development of Smart Cities as a whole along with Smart Homes. One of the simplest tasks is to switch a light source, HVAC systems or any other electrical equipment on or off, by being physically present in the premises, remotely or automatically based on time or a sensor's reading. Furthermore, the intensity of the light source, the temperature of the HVAC systems and such parameters could also be varied. Development of technology in the field has enabled the production of cheap and small-sized computers like Raspberry Pi which are also known as Single Board Computers (SBC). The prototype designed is equipped with a secure local MQTT link for communication between the control and automation system and the Edge Devices. Additionally, it is equipped with a speech recognition system to give the users a much more intuitive and natural mean to communicate with and control the connected devices.},

abstract={This paper describes a framework for constructing network services for accessing media objects. The framework, called end-to-end media paths, provides a new approach for building multimedia applications from component pieces. Based on input from the user and resource requirements from the media object, the system first discovers the sequence of nodes (end-to-end path) that both connect the source device to the sink device and possess sufficient resources to play the object. It then configures the individual nodes along this path with the modules (path segment) that implement the service.},

abstract={Now a day's mobile devices like Smartphone, tablets and Personal Digital Assistants etc. were playing most essential part in our daily lives. A high-end mobile device performs the same functionality as computers. Android based smart phone has become more vulnerable, because of an open source operating system. Anyone can develop a new application and post it into android market. These types of applications were not verified by authorized company. So it may include malevolent applications it may be virus, spyware, worms, etc. which can cause system failure, wasting memory resources, corrupting data, stealing personal information and also increases the maintenance cost. Due to these reasons, the mobile phone security or mobile security is very essential one in mobile computing. In the existing system is not able to detect new viruses, due to the limitation of updated signatures. The proposed system aims to motivate static code analysis based malware detection using search based machine learning algorithm which is called N-gram analysis and it detects the unnoticed malicious characteristics or vulnerabilities in the mobile applications.},

abstract={A class of languages C is perfect if it is closed under Boolean operations and the emptiness problem is decidable. Perfect language classes are the basis for the automata-theoretic approach to model checking: a system is correct if the language generated by the system is disjoint from the language of bad traces. Regular languages are perfect, but because the disjointness problem for context-free languages is undecidable, no class containing them can be perfect. In practice, verification problems for language classes that are not perfect are often under-approximated by checking if the property holds for all behaviors of the system belonging to a fixed subset. A general way to specify a subset of behaviors is by using bounded languages. A class of languages C is perfect modulo bounded languages if it is closed under Boolean operations relative to every bounded language, and if the emptiness problem is decidable relative to every bounded language. We consider finding perfect classes of languages modulo bounded languages. We show that the class of languages accepted by multi-head pushdown automata are perfect modulo bounded languages, and characterize the complexities of decision problems. We also show that bounded languages form a maximal class for which perfection is obtained. We show that computations of several known models of systems, such as recursive multi-threaded programs, recursive counter machines, and communicating finite-state machines can be encoded as multi-head pushdown automata, giving uniform and optimal underapproximation algorithms modulo bounded languages.},

abstract={In this paper, a zero-conf networking approach with open source code to multimedia service is developed and a self-managed multimedia service system is presented. The goal of zero-conf networking technique is to enable the automatic configuration of network devices, automatic service recovery, and automatic service conduct without professional operators involved. Zero-conf networks greatly reduce the inconvenience caused by the deployments of networks and services, ease the service access of users and improve the efficiency of multimedia service networks. Zero-conf networking technique not only benefits the promising digital home applications but also the applications on ad hoc networks. In the implemented multimedia service system, users enjoy the simple and effective operational interface to retrieve the multimedia content from network without professional configuration. Experimental results demonstrate that the implemented system has the advantages of (1) easy user interface (2) low system resource requirement (3) high throughout of multimedia services (4) automatic service discovery. Besides, the performance of the Bonjour is also evaluated in various dimensions of server resource and network bandwidth to explore the critical factors of designing a multimedia service on zero-configuration networks.},

abstract={We present a design for an energetically autonomous artificial organism, combining two subsystems; a bio-inspired energy source and bio-inspired actuation. The work is the first demonstration of energetically autonomy in a microbial fuel cell (MFC)-powered, swimming robot taking energy from it's surrounding, aqueous environment. In contrast to previous work using stacked MFC power sources, the Row-bot employs a single microbial fuel cell as an artificial stomach and uses commercially available voltage step-up hardware to produce usable voltages. The energy generated exceeds the energy requirement to complete the mechanical actuation needed to refuel. Energy production and actuation are demonstrated separately with the results showing that the combination of these subsystems will produce closed-loop energetic autonomy. The work shows a crucial step in the development of autonomous robots capable of long term self-power. Bio-inspiration for the design of the Row-bot was taken from the water boatman beetle. This proof of concept study opens many avenues for the further development of the subsystems comprising the Row-bot, and the functionality of the robot itself.},

abstract={Of the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on developer wages, up to 25% accounts for fixing bugs. Companies like Google save significant human effort and engineering costs with automatic bug detection tools, yet automatically fixing them is still a nascent endeavour. Very recent work (including our own) demonstrates the feasibility of automatic program repair in practice. As automated repair technology matures, it presents great appeal for integration into developer workflows. We believe software bots are a promising vehicle for realizing this integration, as they bridge the gap between human software development and automated processes. We envision repair bots orchestrating automated refactoring and bug fixing. To this end, we explore what building a repair bot entails. We draw on our understanding of patch generation, validation, and real world software development interactions to identify six principles that bear on engineering repair bots and discuss related design challenges for integrating human workflows. Ultimately, this work aims to foster critical focus and interest for making repair bots a reality.},

abstract={One of the main and serious threats on the Internet is Spam. Spam refers to the abuse of electronic messaging system by sending unrequested bulk messages randomly. Botnets are considered one of the main contributors to the sources of spam. Botnet refers to a group of software called bots. The function of these bots is to run on several compromised computers autonomously and automatically. Spamming causes illegal consuming of network resources in general and mail system in particular. The objective of this research is to detect the source of spam on the network by detecting the abnormal behaviors that reflect spamming activities. Behavioral-based Spam Detector (BSD) combines several behaviors of the spam bots at different stages including the behavior of spam preparation before the spam session when the spammers search for an open relay SMTP service to send e-mails through, and the behavior of spammers while connecting to the mail server. The proposed method monitors the network traffic for group malicious activities. The relationship between the host behaviors that trigger suspicion is used to find out if there are any Spam bots or Botnet members within the network. Detecting the abnormal behavior produced by the spam activities gives a high rate of suspicion on the existence of bots.},

abstract={Chatbots are agents that enable the interaction of users and software by means of written or spoken natural language conversation. Their use is growing, and many companies are starting to offer their services via chatbots, e.g., for booking, shopping or customer support. For this reason, many chatbot development tools have emerged, which makes choosing the most appropriate tool difficult. Moreover, there is hardly any support for migrating chatbots between tools. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model-driven engineering solution that includes: (i) a domain-specific language to model chatbots independently of the development tool; (ii) a recommender that suggests the most suitable development tool for the given chatbot requirements and model; (iii) code generators that synthesize the chatbot code for the selected tool; and (iv) parsers to extract chatbot models out of existing chatbot implementations. Our solution is supported by a web IDE called Conga that can be used for both chatbot creation and migration. A demo video is available at https://youtu.be/3sw1FDdZ7XY.},

Porting the software system on embedded devices or palmtops are just two examples. This paper presents an approach to re-factoring libraries with the aim of reducing the memory requirements of executables. The approach is organized in two steps. The first step defines an initial solution based on clustering methods, while the subsequent phase refines the initial solution via genetic algorithms. In particular, a novel genetic algorithm approach, considering the initial clusters as the starting population, adopting a knowledge-based mutation function and a multiobjective fitness function, is proposed. The approach has been applied to several medium and large-size open source software systems such as GRASS, KDE-QT Samba and MySQL, allowing one to effectively produce smaller loosely coupled libraries, and to reduce the memory requirement for each application.},

abstract={Several technologies and products have emerged in the market lately for Personal Digital Assistants and smartphone data forensic acquisition. The smartphone market is very huge and provides a great variety of manufacturers and models causing a strong heterogeneity of the tools adopted to retrieve smartphone contents in a forensically sound way: in fact, in most cases, the mobile devices manufacturers implement their own (proprietary) protocols on the proprietary cable-jack and the proprietary OSs, causing the forensic operators to be overwhelmed by the one-on-one tools for every single mobile device. This paper aims to propose a new methodology and a tool to acquire the data by using the removable memory cards (e.g. SD, mini SD, MMC etc). This approach could represent a breakthrough in the mobile forensics, since the developed tool could replace the plethora of the hardware tools currently used. In this paper, firstly, we will summarize the current seizure methodology and its related problems when applied to the mobile device scenario. Then, we will introduce an alternative methodology to seize and examine the data from internal memory, overcoming some problems of the traditional methodology. At the end, we will show some experimental results of this methodology, obtained from a real device.},

The demand to take these tools out of the office through small, lightweight hand-held devices called personal digital assistants (PDAs) has been especially fervent. Manufacturers have had to scramble to supply this demand, but have run into problems with size, weight, batteries and operating systems (OSs). In order to solve these problems, the BTRON OS was singled out because it operates on very few resources, which makes it perfect for use in PDAs, and through the addition of power management functions, Seiko Instruments Inc. (SII) was able to create the BTRON-Brain Pad, the world's first PDA to run on the BTRON OS with long-life, small batteries for lightweight portability.

abstract={First Person Shooter (FPS) is a popular genre in online gaming, unfortunately not everyone plays the game fairly, and this hinders the growth of the industry. The aiming robot (aimbot) is a common cheating mechanism employed in this genre, it differs from many other common online bots in that there is a human operating alongside the bot, and thus the in-game data exhibit both human and bot-like behaviour. The aimbot users can aim much better than the average player. However, there are also a large number of highly skilled players who can aim much better than the average player, some of these players have in the past been banned from servers due to false accusations from their peers. Therefore, it would be interesting to find out if and where the honest player's and the bot user's behaviour differ. In this paper we investigate the difference between the aiming abilities of aimbot users and honest human players. We introduce two novel features and have conducted an experiment using a modified open source FPS game. Our data shows that there is significant difference between behaviours of honest players and aimbot users. We propose a voting scheme to improve aimbot detection in FPS based on distribution matching, and have achieved approximately 93% in both True positive and True negative rates with one of our features.},

abstract={Biometrics represents a promising approach for reliable and secure user authentication. However, they have not yet been widely adopted in embedded systems, particularly in resource-constrained devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). In this paper, we investigate the challenges involved in using face-based biometrics for authenticating a user to an embedded system. To enable high authentication accuracy, we consider robust face verifiers based on principal component analysis/linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) algorithms and Bayesian classifiers, and their combined use (multi-modal biometrics). Since embedded systems are severely constrained in their processing capabilities, algorithms that provide sufficient accuracy tend to be computationally expensive, leading to unacceptable authentication times. On the other hand, achieving acceptable performance often comes at the cost of degradation in the quality of results. Our work aims at developing embedded processing architectures that improve face verification speed with minimal hardware requirements and without any compromise in verification accuracy. We analyze the computational characteristics of face verifiers when running on an embedded processor, and systematically identify opportunities for accelerating their execution. We then present a range of targeted hardware and software enhancements that include the use of fixed-point arithmetic, various code optimizations, application-specific custom instructions and co-processors, and parallel processing capabilities in multi-processor systems-on-chip (SoCs). We evaluated the proposed architectures in the context of open-source face verification algorithms running on a commercial embedded processor (Xtensa from Tensilica). Our work shows that fast, in-system verification is possible even in the context of many resource-constrained embedded systems. We also demonstrate that high authentication accuracy can be achieved with minimum hardware overheads, while requiring no modifications to the core face verification algorithms},

To make proper investment decisions, investors usually need to collect and analyze a huge amount of financial data beforehand. Nevertheless, human cognitive power is too limited to extract relevant information from the huge amount of raw data and to develop correct decisions in real-time. This paper illustrates the design and implementation of an open Web services based on-demand financial investment system which specializes in option trading. Corporate or individual Investors can subscribe to the aforementioned financial investment services so as to receive prompt advice for specific types of investment options. The proposed financial investment Web services can autonomously collect large amount of real-time data from various on-line sources and develop accurate predictions according to rigorous investment appraisal models. Based on a user profile, the system can provide personalized recommendation with reference to the specific risk-return trade-off of a subscriber. According to our empirical testing, the proposed option rating service can provide more accurate real-time predictions about the prices of options when compared with the online option calculator provided by a well-known financial investment company.},

abstract={Conversational agents assist traditional teaching-learning instruments in proposing new designs for knowledge creation and learning analysis, across organizational environments. Means of building common educative background in both industry and academic fields become of interest for ensuring educational effectiveness and consistency. Such a context requires transferable practices and becomes the basis for the Agile adoption into Higher Education, at both curriculum and operational levels. The current work proposes a model for delivering Agile Scrum training through an assistive web-based conversational service, where analytics are collected to provide an overview on learners' knowledge path. Besides its specific applicability into Software Engineering (SE) industry, the model is to assist the academic SE curriculum. A user-acceptance test has been carried out among 200 undergraduate students and patterns of interaction have been depicted for 2 conversational strategies.},

abstract={Most state-of-the-art speaker verification systems need a user model built from samples of the customer speech, and a speaker independent (SI) background model with high acoustic resolution. These systems rely heavily on the availability of speaker independent databases along with a priori knowledge about acoustic rules of the utterance, and depend on the consistency of acoustic conditions under which the SI models were trained. These constraints may be a burden in practical and portable devices such as palm-top computers or wireless handsets which place a premium on computation and memory, and where the user is free to choose any password utterance in any language, under any acoustic condition. In this paper, we present a novel and reliable approach to background model design when only the enrollment data is available. Preliminary results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of such systems.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and implementation of the Puma middleware system. Puma enables pervasive access to Web applications from a wide range of clients. In addition to traditional, browser-equipped client devices such as laptops and PDAs, Puma supports the use of peer collaboration tools such as instant messengers, SMS devices, email clients and telephones. While those collaboration tools were initially intended for free-form interaction between people, Puma leverages them for structured interaction between people and computers in order to offer more flexibility, convenience and intimacy to end users. In addition to user-initiated, or pull-based, interactions, Puma allows an application to proactively push an interaction to a user, in a manner sensitive to the application's needs and the user's current context. Architecturally, Puma employs various Modality Bots to mediate between application servers and heterogeneous clients. The Modality Bots also serve as the initial point of contact for application-initiated interactions. As an experiment, Puma has been used to mobilize the human tasks application, which supports the creation, processing, and management of the manual steps in business processes.},

abstract={Improvements in computer hardware and software have governed the design of embodied conversational agents, and there has been little empirical research related to the development of full-body agents that exhibit visual and auditory properties to convey instructional information in engineering programs. The purpose of this study is to utilize recently developed software to formulate agents specifically developed to function in a knowledge-based learning environment and provide non-verbal expressions through gaze, gesture, and locomotion. Embodied conversational agents are computer-generated images with lifelike facial features and body movements, capable of performing a collaborating role as instructors. Agents generally resemble human-like forms with auditory qualities that range from human to cartoon. This study focuses on the development of agents that are functional in a variety of educational environments and learning domains.},

abstract={The ever-increasing complexity of modern software engineering projects makes the usage of automated assistants imperative. Bots can be used to complete repetitive tasks during development and testing, as well as promoting communication between team members through issue reporting and documentation. Although the ultimate aim of these automated assistants is to speed taskwork completion, their inclusion into GitHub repositories may affect teamwork as well. This paper studies the question of how bots modify the team workflow. We examined the event sequences of repositories with bots and without bots using a contrast motif discovery method to detect subsequences that are more prevalent in one set of event sequences vs. the other. Our study reveals that teams with bots are more likely to intersperse comments throughout their coding activities, while not actually being more prolific commenters.},

abstract={The “network neutrality bot” (Neubot) is an evolving software architecture for distributed Internet access quality and network neutrality measurements. The core of this architecture is an open-source agent that ordinary users may install on their computers to gain a deeper understanding of their Internet connections. The agent periodically monitors the quality of service provided to the user, running background active transmission tests that emulate different application-level protocols. The results are then collected on a central server and made publicly available to allow constant monitoring of the state of the Internet by interested parties. In this article we describe how we enhanced Neubot architecture both to deploy a distributed broadband speed test and to allow the development of plug-in transmission tests. In addition, we start a preliminary discussion on the results we have collected in the first three months after the first public release of the software.},

abstract={Among Real-Time Strategy games few titles have enjoyed the continued success of StarCraft. Many research lines aimed at developing Artificial Intelligences, or “bots”, capable of challenging human players, use StarCraft as a platform. Several characteristics make this game particularly appealing for researchers, such as: asymmetric balanced factions, considerable complexity of the technology trees, large number of units with unique features, and potential for optimization both at the strategical and tactical level. In literature, various works exploit evolutionary computation to optimize particular aspects of the game, from squad formation to map exploration; but so far, no evolutionary approach has been applied to the development of a complete strategy from scratch. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of StarCraftGP, a framework able to evolve a complete strategy for StarCraft, from the building plan, to the composition of squads, up to the set of rules that define the bot's behavior during the game. The proposed approach generates strategies as C++ classes, that are then compiled and executed inside the OpprimoBot open-source framework. In a first set of runs, we demonstrate that StarCraftGP ultimately generates a competitive strategy for a Zerg bot, able to defeat several human-designed bots.},

abstract={Bots that support software development ("DevBots") are seen as a promising approach to deal with the ever-increasing complexity of modern software engineering and development. Existing DevBots are already able to relieve developers from routine tasks such as building project images or keeping dependencies up-to-date. However, advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence hold the promise of future, significantly more advanced, DevBots. In this paper, we introduce the terminology of contemporary and ideal DevBots. Contemporary DevBots represent the current state of practice, which we characterise using a facet-based taxonomy. We exemplify this taxonomy using 11 existing, industrial-strength bots. We further provide a vision and definition of future (ideal) DevBots, which are not only autonomous, but also adaptive, as well as technically and socially competent. These properties may allow ideal DevBots to act more akin to artificial team mates than simple development tools.},

This device is intended for COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome. System Design: CBH is composed of thermoplastic polyurethane, which creates a flexible neck seal and transparent hood. This device can be connected to wall oxygen, NIPPVs including Continuous Positive Airway Pressure and Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure, and mechanical ventilators. Discussion: Justification of CBH design components relied on several factors, predominantly the safety and comfort of patients and healthcare providers. Conclusion: CBH has implications within and outside of the pandemic, as an alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation methods. We have experimentally verified that CBH is effective in minimizing aerosolization risks and performs at specified clinical requirements.},

To address the above issues, this research utilizes the technology of Citizen Digital Certificate, digital signature, and blockchain to establish an authorization system for digital personal data, referred to as PDAS (Personal Data Authorization System). By using PDAS, user data can be conveniently authorized by creating safe, undeniable, and tamper-proof data authorization contracts. Data requesters can acquire authorizations from multiple users as well as obtain integrated and authorized datasets.},

abstract={Bali is a world tourism destination for its cultural riches. Balinese culture is a legacy of the world's riches that must be preserved. In the development of the education world and technology today, there have been many efforts done to preserve Balinese culture such as researches used to document Balinese cultures. One study for the preservation of Balinese culture in the field of technology is the Balinese script transliteration application. Balinese script is one of the traditional Indonesian archipelago that created in Bali. Because its use is limited to a narrow scope in everyday use, most Balinese script has been replaced with Latin letters. Therefore this research is focused on preserving Balinese script using robot technology. The robot that developed in this research is a robot that can write Balinese script using a design resembles a human arm. Its connected to the computer using USB and mDraw a graphics program developed based on open source python. mDraw will give input to the robot in .svg format that generated by the Pasang Aksara transliteration application. This .svg or vector as input mDraw will give command to the robot to write the transliteration result on a piece of paper. In this paper a new idea has been proposed to implement the robot on cultural preservation and Balinese script education. This robotic arm was successfully tested and the result are 60% (21 glyph) categorized as very good, 37.14% (13 glyph) categorized as good, and 2.86% (1 glyph) enough. And for the Pasang Aksara transliteration application obtained the result of accuracy 75,73 % (of 861 words) for the correct test count and 24,7 % (of 276 words) for wrong test, count from 1137 word on thirteen kinds of special word in transliteration rules. For future development, replacement servo motors are located on the pen to make the process on the ups and downs of the pen smoother for more accurate Balinese script writing by the robot. The FSA method used is still constrained by some special words that failed to be transliterated correctly, so it is necessary to develop a certain algorithm so the accuracy of transliteration can reach 100%.},

abstract={The real-time strategy game StarCraft has proven to be a challenging environment for artificial intelligence techniques, and as a result, current state-of-the-art solutions consist of numerous hand-crafted modules. In this paper, we show how macromanagement decisions in StarCraft can be learned directly from game replays using deep learning. Neural networks are trained on 789,571 state-action pairs extracted from 2,005 replays of highly skilled players, achieving top-1 and top-3 error rates of 54.6% and 22.9% in predicting the next build action. By integrating the trained network into UAlbertaBot, an open source StarCraft bot, the system can significantly outperform the game's built-in Terran bot, and play competitively against UAlbertaBot with a fixed rush strategy. To our knowledge, this is the first time macromanagement tasks are learned directly from replays in StarCraft. While the best hand-crafted strategies are still the state-of-the-art, the deep network approach is able to express a wide range of different strategies and thus improving the network's performance further with deep reinforcement learning is an immediately promising avenue for future research. Ultimately this approach could lead to strong StarCraft bots that are less reliant on hard-coded strategies.},

abstract={Our experience shows that a typical industrial project can enhance software engineering research and bring theories to life. The University of Kentucky (UK) is in the initial phase of developing a software engineering curriculum. The first course, a graduate-level survey of software engineering, strongly emphasized quality engineering. assisted by the UK clinic, the students undertook a project to develop a phenylalanine milligram tracker. It helps phenylketonuria (PKU) sufferers to monitor their diet as well as assists PKU researchers to collect data. The project was also used as an informal experimental study. The applied project approach to teaching software engineering appears to be successful thus far. The approach taught many important software and quality engineering principles to inexperienced graduate students in an accurately simulated industrial development environment. It resulted in the development of a framework for describing and evaluating such a real-world project, including evaluation of the notion of a user advocate. It also resulted in interesting experimental trends, though based on a very small sample. Specifically, estimation skills seem to improve over time and function point estimation may be more accurate than LOC estimation.},

abstract={Electronic Systems Reliability Analysis is based on Failure Rates (FR), which is mostly predicted using physics of failures techniques. In fact, we assume that the “electronic design” is near to perfect, and that the FR is based only on the physical materials. However, based on field failures analysis, we have found that many failures actually occur due in large part to a poor design, and that this poor design is mostly caused by common mistakes. In this article, a new method will be introduced, which will provide guidelines to understanding the root cause of common design mistakes and eliminating them. These common design mistakes will then be transformed into a set of rules that we call a "rule check," which will ensure that these very same mistakes will be detected and eliminated in new designs. Thousands of electronic board failures were collected for the duration of one year. The data was analyzed statistically, and for the 100 most important failures a root cause analysis was performed. It was found that 50 out of the 100 mistakes occurred due to errors in the design and these errors were based on common mistakes. To avoid these mistakes from reoccurring, a dictionary of rules was created which we call "Good Design Reliability Practice" (GDRP). The statistics show that the field failures are categorized as: - 25% are overstressed components and need to be up rated, - 35% are mistakes which increase the power dissipation and if we correct the mistake the power will be reduced, - 10% are mistakes which looks as if they are software failures but actually are hardware failures. - 30% are pure GDRP mistakes, such as pull-up /pull-down resistors, technology match, resistance/ capacitance values, power supply match etc. As of today we have successfully collected over 200 design rules, which have been grouped into five categories. These rules are used in the scanning of new designs, and significantly help eliminate the mistakes from reoccurring. Doing so dramatically increases the product's reliability (power dissipation and stress will be reduced) and robustness (design will be free from design errors). The innovation of the method is that by analyzing field failure data analysis we can setup rules which are checked in new designs.},

pages={254-265},
abstract={Vulnerable dependencies are a major problem in modern software development. As software projects depend on multiple external dependencies, developers struggle to constantly track and check for corresponding security vulnerabilities that affect their project dependencies. To help mitigate this issue, Dependabot has been created, a bot that issues pull-requests to automatically update vulnerable dependencies. However, little is known about the degree to which developers adopt Dependabot to help them update vulnerable dependencies. In this paper, we investigate 2,904 JavaScript open-source GitHub projects that subscribed to Dependabot. Our results show that the vast majority (65.42%) of the created security-related pull-requests are accepted, often merged within a day. Through manual analysis, we identify 7 main reasons for Dependabot security pull-requests not being merged, mostly related to concurrent modifications of the affected dependencies rather than Dependabot failures. Interestingly, only 3.2% of the manually examined pull-requests suffered from build breakages. Finally, we model the time it takes to merge a Dependabot security pull-request using characteristics from projects, the fixed vulnerabilities and issued pull requests. Our model reveals 5 significant features to explain merge times, e.g., projects with relevant experience with Dependabot security pull-requests are most likely associated with rapid merges. Surprisingly, the severity of the dependency vulnerability and the potential risk of breaking changes are not strongly associated with the merge time. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate how developers receive Dependabot's security contributions. Our findings indicate that Dependabot provides an effective platform for increasing awareness of dependency vulnerabilities and helps developers mitigate vulnerability threats in JavaScript projects.},

abstract={Initially, legitimate users were working under a normal web browser to do all activities over the internet [1]. To get more secure service and to get protection against Bot activity, the legitimate users switched their activity from Normal web browser to low latency anonymous communication such as Tor Browser. The Traffic monitoring in Tor Network is difficult as the packets are traveling from source to destination in an encrypted fashion and the Tor network hides its identity from destination. But lately, even the illegitimate users such as attackers/criminals started their activity on the Tor browser. The secured Tor network makes the detection of Botnet more difficult. The existing tools for botnet detection became inefficient against Tor-based bots because of the features of the Tor browser. As the Tor Browser is highly secure and because of the ethical issues, doing practical experiments on it is not advisable which could affect the performance and functionality of the Tor browser. It may also affect the endanger users in situations where the failure of Tor's anonymity has severe consequences. So, in the proposed research work, Private Tor Networks (PTN) on physical or virtual machines with dedicated resources have been created along with Trusted Middle Node. The motivation behind the trusted middle node is to make the Private Tor network more efficient and to increase its performance.},

abstract={Involving the user in a simulated world introduces a new prospective in the agent-based simulation research. We propose a method of using a game development platform in designing a multiagent system based on the Blackboard architectural pattern, which provides a practical scenario to traffic simulation by showing the interaction between the pedestrians and the vehicles. Besides generating the log on the incidents happening and letting the user observe the simulation, our system also allows the user to get involved in the simulated world as a driver of a vehicle to interact with other cars and people walking around. The issues in analyzing the requirements of agents and implementing agents in an existing platform introduce a new challenge in software design. This work is a result of our agent-based software engineering research and reports a design method of integrating an existing platform with an architectural pattern to realize agent-based simulation in hosting different types of drivers and pedestrians in a simulated city blocks.},

abstract={Requirements extraction is an important element of the software development process. One of the most used techniques for requirements extraction is the interview. Initiatives to support the training and technical training of computing students in this area are being proposed, such as the development of support mechanisms. These initiatives are proposed by the fact that computing students are graduating with limited practical knowledge in requirements extraction. In parallel, chatterbots have been investigated as tools with the capacity to support the training of students from different areas of knowledge, since the main characteristic is verbal conversational behavior. In medicine, for example, they can take on the role of a sick patient to train students to extract information about the patient's symptoms. One subject that has been explored in the context of educational chatterbots is context awareness, so that the chatterbot can present the right information for the right user. These surveys start from the premise that not every student has the same knowledge as their peers on the subject. Thus, in this research work in full paper we describe a chatterbot that offers support to Software Engineering Education, focusing mainly on the requirements extraction, which assumes the role of a stakeholder. A prototype of a chatterbot that is sensitive to student's context is presented, as well as preliminary results on the impact of this support mechanism in Software Engineering Education.},

abstract={Basically all companies today go beyond the development of single products and offer set(s) of similar and related products. In marketing, one such set is often called a product line. Nevertheless, still today most products are not yet engineered as product lines, i.e., they are not yet derived from a single platform. In this paper, we explore the relation of these two forms of product lines. It is shown that under certain circumstances engineered and marketed software product line subsume different products. This paper shows how these two perspectives differ and why a difference in products between these perspectives may be appropriate from a company perspective. Finally, it is argued that activities currently subsumed under product management and scoping should be closely coordinated, allowing companies to optimize their product portfolios since decision-making is facilitated},

abstract={This paper proposes a mobile, intelligent agent-based framework that allows buyers and sellers to perform business at remote locations. A business participant can generate a mobile, intelligent agent via a mobile device and dispatch the agent to the Internet to do business. The proposed framework brings in several advantages: First, it provides great convenience for traders as business can be conducted anytime and anywhere. Secondly, the user is freed from the time-consuming task of finding and negotiating with appropriate traders. Thirdly, it addresses the problem of limited and expensive connection time for mobile users: A trader can disconnect her mobile device from its server after launching a mobile agent. Later on, she can reconnect and call back the agent for results, therefore minimizing the connection time. Finally, by complying with the standardization body of FIPA, this flexible framework increases the interoperability between agent systems and provides high design scalability.},

abstract={Swarm robotics is based on the characteristics displayed by the insects and their colony and is applied to solve real world problems utilizing multi-robot systems. Research in this field has demonstrated the ability of such robot systems to assemble, inspect, disperse, aggregate and follow trails. A set of mobile and self-sufficient robots which has very restricted capabilities can form intricate patterns in the environment they inhabit. The simple patterns can be used by the robots to achieve high level tasks. In the proposed work, a set of robots are coordinating to form a specific pattern around the object with step wise linear motion and are programmed to push the object from a source position to the destination in an obstacle free environment. Initially the robots are placed in known positions. ZigBee communication protocol is used for interaction among the robots. A single robot is chosen as a central coordinator and controls the movement of the rest of the robots in the swarm. Master bot decides on the path to be taken and also supplies the slave bots with the coordinates to be reached. The entire scenario has been simulated using the open source tool Player/Stage and the hardware implementation has been done using micromouse chassis set up and the Arduino Uno controller board.},

Several methods to provide robotic hardware for research are introduced, starting from the maintenance of a common open-source repository, to the making available of simulation models of the hardware components and the possibility of remote access via a web-interface. It is shown, that Care-O-bot(R) 3 is particularly suited as research platform through the modular structure of its hardware components. Thus, a very flexible set-up for Care-O-bot(R) 3 is possible, making it easy to adapt to the specific requirements of different robotic research fields.},

abstract={There has been a lot of interest in the embedded systems community on architectures and design methods that are targeted towards multimedia applications. This trend is pri marily motivated by the proliferation of resource and power-constrained portable devices (such as mobile phones and PDAs), a major portion of whose workload is made up of multimedia applications. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoffs between video quality and the processor cycle requirements in such resource-constrained devices, in the particular context of MPEG-4 decoding using an open source codec called XviD. The XviD codec implements a number of powerful coding tools from MPEG-4, which are organized as profiles and levels. Given the specification of an architecture on which an XviD decoder is implemented, the work presented here would guide a multimedia applications developer in selecting appropriate profiles and levels for the corresponding encoder application. While the selection of such profiles has so far been primarily influenced by the network bandwidth in the case of video streaming, our work stresses the importance of additionally taking into account the architecture of the device running the decoder application. Although the relevance of this observation is increasingly being realized, sufficient work has not yet been done to provide guidelines on how to systematically make such selections. This work attempts to address this shortcoming.},

abstract={Recent developments in smart assistants and smart home automation are lately attracting the interest and curiosity of consumers and researchers. Speech enabled virtual assistants (often named smart speakers) offer a wide variety of network-oriented services and, in some cases, can connect to smart environments, thus enhancing them with new and effective user interfaces. However, such devices also reveal new needs and some weaknesses. In particular, they represent faceless and blind assistants, unable to show a face, and therefore an emotion, and unable to `see' the user. As a consequence, the interaction is impaired and, in some cases, ineffective. Moreover, most of those devices heavily rely on cloud-based services, thus transmitting potentially sensitive data to remote servers. To overcome such issues, in this paper we combine some of the most advanced techniques in computer vision, deep learning, speech generation and recognition, and artificial intelligence, into a virtual assistant architecture for smart home automation systems. The proposed assistant is effective and resource-efficient, interactive and customizable, and the realized prototype runs on a low-cost, small-sized, Raspberry PI 3 device. For testing purposes, the system was integrated with an open source home automation environment and ran for several days, while people were encouraged to interact with it, and proved to be accurate, reliable and appealing.},

abstract={JXTA is a peer-to-peer technology that enables developers to easily create distributed computing software. This paper describes JXTA (short for "juxtapose") in general and focuses on its applicability, for mobile-networked systems. Since mobile devices like PDAs, mobile phones, or laptop computers are much more likely to interoperate with each other in the absence of a coordinating authority such as a server there is an obvious need for a technology above the hardware abstraction level of IrDA and Bluetooth. JXTA enables mobile devices running on various platforms not only to share data with each other, but also to use functions of their respective peers. A general overview of the JXTA specification, the corresponding protocols, and mobile peer-to-peer aspects is presented. Furthermore, the current status of an open source JXTA implementation for Java is outlined This paper analyzes to what extent mobile devices are suitable for a peer-to-peer approach and how this approach can be realized with JXTA. To emphasize the practical impacts of a peer-to-peer approach some applications are described, which are based on the authors' current projects. This includes a hospital scenario, as well as an example for a distributed electronic patient health record. These examples are helpful, because they include security, data protection, wireless and mobile technology, and reliability.},

One technology currently investigated as a possible enabler is Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN). It is a reasonable assumption that the applications that are the presently most used in the “normal” internet will continue to be of most importance also in hitherto not ICT covered areas. But, for local SMEs the rational may rather be development of specialized services, exploiting DTN technology to increase the efficiency and market potentials for their activities in remote locations. To achieve this, hardware and open source software are put together to form a node system that make up the DTN applications, custom built to the situation with focus on power management, routing schemes and custom made software based on user need. These nodes are tested with users in real life test beds, enabling internet connectivity to reach even further, without the need for new physical infrastructure.},

abstract={The function of a network intrusion detection system is to identify and react on any abnormal behavior determined as an attack to a network segment or a dedicated host. The proposed concept is based on a distributed network intrusion detection system (D-NIDS) integrated as a pump-in-the-stack process, based on a simplified open source network stack (light weight IP-lwIP). The small process-footprint (multi or single threaded) makes this solution suitable for all platforms and operating systems. Thus, embedded systems as well as high performance PCs or workstations may run this service without operating expense. The proposed solution differs from other solutions by a simple installation process-since no interactions are existing between the host- and the NIDS-stack- and the ability to run applications on top of the IDS (e.g. alluring-systems or sandbox systems). But the main idea is to take advantage of a mechanism known as "state-transition intrusion detection" and the integration of this mechanism into the network stack. The usage of state-transition based signatures can reduce large database entries and allows the reuse of already existing network stacks. Due to small database entries, this approach is highly scalable and can be a proper solution for small devices, PDAs, and embedded systems.},

In this paper, we present a novel mechanism to coordinate devices in a ubiquitous environment with formal methodologies. It ensures non-blocking service provision in consideration of deadlock- and livelock-free properties. An ECA-based framework is developed and the non- blocking property is proved using finite state automata. An illustrative example is provided and an application system is demonstrated.},

The teacher is unable to properly assess the students' knowledge in order to give proper feedback and/or adapt the teaching style and content to the class. We propose a system that runs on PDAs and tablet-PCs having a human-computer interaction model based on gestures and free-hand sketching. The system functionalities allow the teacher to easily create presentation objects and decide the order in which they will be presented to the students and create problems which the students have to solve on the fly during the presentation.

abstract={Online Social Networks (OSNs) are the modern communication media at the peak of Internet technology that facilitate users' ability to connect with friends and celebrities, and to disseminate breaking news and updates on real-life events. Connections and interactions among OSN users generate a massive amount of data containing a rich collection of knowledge that could be useful to various realworld data modeling and predictive analytics problems like open-source intelligence, business intelligence, event prediction, and product recommendations. On the Web, adversaries explore and target products and services for misuse and vulnerabilities, and OSNs are no exception. Their large user base, easy-to-use functionality, and open nature further attract antisocial elements to these OSNs. In OSNs, cybercrimes and illicit activities are generally committed using various forms of fake profiles, such as clone profiles,1 sybil,2 and bots.},

abstract={With the Internet crime growing, such as phishing, money mules, personal data stealing and trafficking, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), and other cases often heard by people from time to time. DDoS mostly uses botnet as source of attack, and distributes trojans and worms to infect hosts. Infected hosts become bots, and could be controlled by the botmaster. Botmaster uses command and control server to control bots. Because botmaster servers use dynamic types and encryption methods to communicate with bots, it's difficult to detect bots. In this research, we designed and developed a system to detect bot-like traffic and deny traffic of who looks like bots. We revised the NTOP program and integrated it with self developed perl programs. Our system will monitor the network layer and transport layer on network activities and send email/SMS to the network administrator to block suspicious botnet.},

It includes different technologies such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and ChatterBot (a machine learning, conversational dialog engine for creating chat bots) to develop intelligence for autonomous control of the robot itself and easy-to-use interfaces for the elderly. The robot equipped with a 2D low cost laser sensor and SLAM technology would be able to build a map in an unknown area and navigate the mapped area after mapping. The ChatterBot provides the learning and conversational dialog engine which provides user-friendly interaction and feedbacks as a robotic companion to the elderly. The OpenCV is mainly used to perform the face detection, face tracking and motion detection tasks. A mobile application software (App) with streaming service is also developed to allow elderly's close relatives to monitor the health status and condition of the elderly.},

abstract={In the evolving ubiquitous Internet landscape, users are willing to play a more central role by modeling and reshaping the Web experience upon their needs. They begin perceiving and exploiting the Web as a platform to collaboratively create and share contents and to communicate with each other. Moreover, they want to decide how to access services and contents, freeing themselves from traditional fixed PCs and adopting heterogeneous wireless devices such as palmtops, smartphones, wireless-enabled portable audio players and so on. The Internet of services scenario stresses several research fields, from multimodality to mobility, from context awareness to service orientation and coordination. Research achievements, anyway, often tend to evolve separately, leading to ad-hoc solutions for specific sets of problems. We strongly believe that such evolving scenarios require a comprehensive support platform: this paper promotes a novel service-oriented middleware to assist users in the pervasive ubiquitous Internet access. The use cases we describe focus on complex scenarios that, in our opinion, will likely be more and more required in the next years.},

abstract={In recent years, website administrators have searched for a tool to prevent automated “bots” from using their sites' resources, hindering legitimate user access. By offering a “challenge” in the form of analyzing a picture for certain features, matching like symbols from a selection, or listening to an audio clip and transcribing the text, these tasks are intended to be easy for humans to solve but impossible for a program to overcome. More recently, there have been many successful attempts at using modern technology to automate passing these challenges. In this paper, we propose a simple approach which makes use of open-source tools (reCaptcha Widget, Selenium - a proxy server pool and a public Speech to Text API) to circumvent the reCaptcha tool utilized by Google. Preliminary results demonstrate an approximately 35% success rate which can be easily improved with minor modification. However, the focal point is the simplicity of the proposed approach to highlight the vulnerability of Google's reCaptcha tool against Speech to Text API attack.},

As we extend these to juniors and seniors, we are evolving both the process and the constructs. In order to study the relationship of MEAs to the problem solving process, we are assessing this process using handheld electronic devices (PDAs) and work measurement software, which capture the predefined steps taken by the students. We have completed a pilot study using PDAs, which showed this approach to be feasible. The design of the pilot study, lessons learned, data obtained, and outcomes requiring additional investigation will be discussed. Much of the data showed a progression through multiple steps of the problem solving process in sequential order.},

In addition, we adopt the data from AlphaGo Master's sixty online games as the training data to construct the knowledge base and rule base of the co-learning system. First, the Darkforest predicts the win rate based on various simulation numbers and matching rates for each game on the OGD platform, then the win rate of OpenGo is as the final desired output.

abstract={The near-far object tracking (NFOT) problem concerns the tracking of an extended object consisting of a set of resolvable sources that, due to finite sensor resolution, appears as a single point when at long range from the sensor. A Gaussian mixture filter for this problem is presented for the case of a linear object comprising a known number of sources. The filter structure is a combination of the probabilistic data association (PDA) filter and the multiple simultaneous measurement filter. The filter takes into account the uncertainty concerning the object's structure and orientation, as well as the presence of false alarms. Simulations for an open-loop pursuit scenario are presented that compare the performance of the filter with another Gaussian mixture filter that does not consider sensor resolution},

The answers are not available on the website; they will be given at the teachers' request. The projects are simple enough to be used with didactic purposes and complex enough to allow the integration in larger applications or to create reference projects for the modules used. These allow the students to understand the features of a microcontroller and their use in implementing and optimizing the applications.},

abstract={Desktop grids are being increasingly used as the execution platform for a variety of applications that can be structured as bag-of-tasks (BoT). Scheduling BoT applications on desktop grids has thus attracted the attention of the scientific community, and various schedulers tailored towards them have been proposed in the literature. However, previous work has focused on scheduling a single BoT application at a time, thus neglecting other scenarios in which several users submit multiple BoT applications at the same time. This paper aims at filling this gap by proposing a set of scheduling algorithms able to deal with multiple BoT applications. The performance of these algorithm has been evaluated, by means of simulation, for a large set of operational scenarios obtained by varying both the workload submitted to the desktop grid and the characteristics of the involved resources. Our results show that, although there is no a clear winner among the proposed solutions, knowledge-free strategies (that is, strategies that do not require any information concerning the applications or the resources) can provide good performance.},

abstract={Computers and human interaction evolved with the emergence of virtual assistants, which in practice is related to the evolution of Question Answering (QA) systems. This evolution demands more powerful, helpful, and aware QA systems, able to provide high-quality answers to a wide range of questions. A way to meet this level of requirement is to combine multiple restricted domain QAs to yield a high-quality open domain QA. This system can use a routing mechanism based on a hierarchical question domain classifier to select the proper restricted QA system to answer the user's question. However, the creation and maintenance of a large and robust dataset of labeled questions required to train this mechanism are impractical to be done by hand. For tackling this problem, in this study, we present a strategy for automatically generating labeled datasets of questions from the same documents used as the sources of information demanded by the QA systems. To validate the proposed approach, we created a large dataset and applied it to train a hierarchical question domain classifier. Next, we evaluated the performance of this classifier using human-elaborated and labeled questions. The results indicated that the questions automatically created have high quality and thus they can be safely used in real-world applications.},

abstract={Metaschedulers can distribute parts of a bag-of-tasks (BoT) application among various resource providers in order to speed up its execution. When providers cannot disclose private information such as their load and computing power, which are usually heterogeneous, the metascheduler needs to make blind scheduling decisions. We propose three policies for composing resource offers to schedule deadline-constrained BoT applications. Offers act as a mechanism in which resource providers expose their interest in executing an entire BoT or only part of it without revealing their load and total computing power. We also evaluate the amount of information resource providers need to expose to the metascheduler and its impact on the scheduling. Our main findings are: (i) offer-based scheduling produces less delay for jobs that cannot meet deadlines in comparison to scheduling based on load availability (i.e. free time slots); thus it is possible to keep providers' load private when scheduling multi-site BoTs; and (ii) if providers publish their total computing power they can have more local jobs meeting deadlines.},

abstract={Over the past few years, a considerable amount of effort has been made in improving the QoS in computer networks. The associated problems become further complicated when the applications are resource intensive, links involved are wireless and the applications are required to execute on small mobile devices (e.g; PDAs). In such scenarios, the applications are desired to adapt to changing network/environmental conditions to give a relatively stable user perceived QoS or in the worst case, go for a graceful degradation. In this paper we describe the architecture, implementation and evaluation of our adaptive runtime environment (ARE) which runs on top of JVM. We exploit application-side adaptation and our approach is based around aspect oriented programming (AOP) to design a reflective runtime environment, spatially and temporally optimized for small foot-print devices. A key feature of this environment is that it is completely free of any user involvement for QoS specification, even then, intelligent enough to make any a/v application adaptive.},

As bullying shifts from playgrounds to social media, the need of the hour is having anti-trolling softwares in place to combat this malpractice. Many internet companies have taken steps in this direction by creating softwares or applications that can prevent trolling but none have been completely successful. The word anti-trolling has existed as a concept for a long time. It is necessary to make it a concrete reality. Most of the softwares identify abusive words and simply block them but trolls have found ways to circumvent this obstacle by using clever ways. This paper explores the currently existing “Anti-trolling systems”, their methodologies and technological challenges. In particular, we consider machine learning and existing expert systems that detect and prevent trolls. The paper concludes with a discussion of the issues faced by this technology, the current functioning and a few suggestions along with a modified architecture and the vision of a trolling-free internet.},

Lean Manufacturing, originally designed for minimizing storage costs and increasing productivity, has been successfully adopted in software development and brought up the popularity of Agile Development in the last couple of decades. In addition to software development, it has extended to development in personal and professional life management, such as Personal Kanban and bunch of TODO-like applications. However, most practices and experiences shared are currently still within original methodology and tools from manufacturing or project development, where adaptation to the personal application has not yet been enough.This paper employs the user story model from requirements engineering to represent personal daily context. The proposed system is designed based on a conversational interface, which maps occurrences from personal daily context into a user story graph extended for describing personal daily context. This paper describes a mechanism of constructing user story graph through a chatbot and illustrates how to use the obtained graph to assist individual task management through a couple of scenarios.},

abstract={The Internet was designed to be neutral with respect to kinds of applications, senders and destinations. Such design choice made very fast packet switching possible, while preserving, at the same time, strong openness towards unforeseen uses of the Internet Protocol. The result has been an extraordinary outburst of innovation, as well as a level playing field for citizens, associations and companies worldwide. With the advent of ldquodeep packet inspectionrdquo technology, however, fine-grained discrimination of Internet flows is now possible, be that for economic or other reasons. Collecting quantitative data on the behavior of telecommunications providers with respect to traffic discrimination thus becomes crucial, particularly at a time when policy changes are widely discussed. The ldquoNetwork Neutrality Botrdquo (Neubot) project is based on a lightweight, open source computer program, the Neubot, that, downloaded and installed by Internet users, performs distributed measurements of the traffic characteristics of segments of the global Internet. The collected data will allow constant monitoring of the actual state of the Internet, enabling both a deeper understanding of such crucial infrastructure and a more reliable basis for discussing network neutrality policies.},

abstract={CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. A CAPTCHA is a program that protects websites against bots -automated scripts by generating and grading tests that humans can pass but current computer programs cannot. For example, humans can read distorted text but current computer programs can't. The threats from bots is growing rapidly and also increasing in technical sophistication causing various types of attacks. These attacks are affecting social aspects of human beings. Human being or legitimate users are cheated by false requests disturbing their social life. This paper aims to provide secured authentification by verifying strength of CAPTCHA. The strength of CAPTCHA can be verified by solving it. The CAPTCHA solving has mainly three steps such as preprocessing, segmentation and character recognition. The input distorted image of CAPTCHA is passed through preprocessing module which removes noise and gives raw image which is then segmented. These segmented characters are recognized using pattern-matching technique achieving 88% accuracy. The result shows that this algorithm provides secured social relevance to avail free Internet services and in turn improve usability of well-claimed CAPTCHA.},

abstract={Due to its popularity and open-source nature, Android is the mobile platform that has been targeted the most by malware that aim to steal personal information or to control the users' devices. More specifically, mobile botnets are malware that allow an attacker to remotely control the victims' devices through different channels like HTTP, thus creating malicious networks of bots. In this paper, we show how it is possible to effectively group mobile botnets families by analyzing the HTTP traffic they generate. To do so, we create malware clusters by looking at specific statistical information that are related to the HTTP traffic. This approach also allows us to extract signatures with which it is possible to precisely detect new malware that belong to the clustered families. Contrarily to x86 malware, we show that using fine-grained HTTP structural features do not increase detection performances. Finally, we point out how the HTTP information flow among mobile bots contains more information when compared to the one generated by desktop ones, allowing for a more precise detection of mobile threats.},

However; the current technological framework supporting information sharing and collaboration along the supply chain has a number of limitations, such as the extensive IT restructuring needed for integrating partner information systems and the high cost inherent in the development and deployment of complex collaboration solutions per se. In this paper we suggest a new technological approach for supporting CPFR practices and further suggest an innovative system implementation based entirely on open-source technologies. Our developed prototype facilitates the process of exchanging partner predictions via a host of different operating devices (PC, PDAs, cellphones).

abstract={The advent of media-sharing sites has led to the unprecedented Internet delivery of community-contributed media like images and videos. Those visual contents have become the primary sources for online advertising. Conventional advertising treats multimedia advertising as general text advertising by displaying advertisements either relevant to the queries or the Web pages, without considering the potential advantages which could be brought by media contents. In this paper, we summarize the trend of Internet multimedia advertising and conduct a broad survey on the methodologies for advertising which are driven by the rich contents of images and videos. We discuss three key problems in a generic multimedia advertising framework. These problems are: contextual relevance that determines the selection of relevant advertisements, contextual intrusiveness which is the key to detect appropriate ad insertion positions within an image or video, and insertion optimization that achieves the best association between the advertisements and insertion positions so that the effectiveness of advertising can be maximized in terms of both contextual relevance and contextual intrusiveness. We show recently developed MediaSense which consists of image, video, and game advertising as an exemplary application of contextual multimedia advertising. In the MediaSense, the most contextually relevant ads are embedded at the most appropriate positions within images or videos. To this end, techniques in computer vision, multimedia retrieval, and computer human interaction are leveraged. We also envision that the next trend of multimedia advertising would be game-like advertising which is more impressionative and thus can promote advertising in an interactive, as well as more compelling and effective way. We conclude this survey with a brief outlook on open research directions.},

There are certain activities involved in cultivation process until it’s marketed. Every day job routine is done by farmer like pruning, fruit thinning, weeding, fertilizing and so on. Those job activities are not in well planned and schedule. The development of NangKOM software could help the farmers for their daily activities in this industry. NangKOM has been developed using web based technology and open source tools like PHP, MySQL database and Apache Web Server. NangKOM application will be accessed through mobile devices using Wi-Fi technology. The entire task schedule will be recorded and identified for the next job or task to do. These tools could produce forecasting result for jackfruit in graphical graph format and analysis. Therefore, it is hoped that NangKOM could improve and increase the productivity of Agriculture field in Malaysia.},

abstract={Research has shown that over half of those with MCI will develop dementia within 5 years. In 2017, approximately 50 million people have dementia in the world. Moreover, dementia is now the 7th leading cause of death. Now almost 600 thousand people aged 65 or over are MCI in Taiwan. The ratio of people aged 65 years or over in Taiwan will reach 20% by 2025. According to the results of several studies, 3-19% of adults over the age of 65 meet the criteria for MCI. The majority of care for PWCI is provided by family carers. Using assistive technologies (AT) to help PWCI live independently can reduce the costs of care for PWCI. AT can support communication, monitor and reminders to meet the requirements of socialization, safety and cognition for PWCI, respectively. In this research, we propose an intelligent cognition assistant (iCA) to improve living qualities for PWCI using modern assistive technologies. The system has three major functions: companion, cognitive rehabilitation and evaluation, and daily activities assistant. A friendly and intelligent dialog interface, digital cognitive exercises, multidimensional cognitive evaluation and activities monitors are provided to achieve these goals.},

abstract={Automated tools are frequently used in social coding repositories to perform repetitive activities that are part of the distributed software development process. Recently, GitHub introduced GitHub Actions, a feature providing automated work-flows for repository maintainers. Although several Actions have been built and used by practitioners, relatively little has been done to evaluate them. Understanding and anticipating the effects of adopting such kind of technology is important for planning and management. Our research is the first to investigate how developers use Actions and how several activity indicators change after their adoption. Our results indicate that, although only a small subset of repositories adopted GitHub Actions to date, there is a positive perception of the technology. Our findings also indicate that the adoption of GitHub Actions increases the number of monthly rejected pull requests and decreases the monthly number of commits on merged pull requests. These results are especially relevant for practitioners to understand and prevent undesirable effects on their projects.},

abstract={We address the dimensioning of infrastructure, comprising both network and server resources, for large-scale decentralized distributed systems such as grids or clouds. We design the resulting grid/cloud to be resilient against network link or server failures. To this end, we exploit relocation: Under failure conditions, a grid job or cloud virtual machine may be served at an alternate destination (i.e., different from the one under failure-free conditions). We thus consider grid/cloud requests to have a known origin, but assume a degree of freedom as to where they end up being served, which is the case for grid applications of the bag-of-tasks (BoT) type or hosted virtual machines in the cloud case. We present a generic methodology based on integer linear programming (ILP) that: chooses a given number of sites in a given network topology where to install server infrastructure; and determines the amount of both network and server capacity to cater for both the failure-free scenario and failures of links or nodes. For the latter, we consider either failure-independent (FID) or failure-dependent (FD) recovery. Case studies on European-scale networks show that relocation allows considerable reduction of the total amount of network and server resources, especially in sparse topologies and for higher numbers of server sites. Adopting a failure-dependent backup routing strategy does lead to lower resource dimensions, but only when we adopt relocation (especially for a high number of server sites): Without exploiting relocation, potential savings of FD versus FID are not meaningful.},

pages={2108-2114},
abstract={Grids have been extensively deployed to handle various scientific and engineering applications that can be structured as bag-of-tasks (BoT). The scheduling of BoT applications on Grids is an important issue for achieving high performance. Grid scheduling involves a number of challenging issues, mainly due to the dynamic nature of the Grid. To deal with this dynamic nature, in this paper, we propose an online scheduling algorithm called prudent algorithm with replication (PAR) for scheduling Grid applications. PAR is shown to prudently make scheduling decisions in such a way that it can tolerate inaccurate performance predictions. Another point to note is that PAR adopts task duplication as an attempt to reduce serious schedule increases. Moreover, since the applications to be performed may widely vary in terms of their required hardware and software, we also capture the loads' various processing requirements in our algorithms, a unique feature that is applicable for running proprietary applications only on certain eligible processing nodes. Thus, in our problem formulation each application can only be processed by certain processors as both the applications and processing nodes are heterogeneous. We then present a task selection policy, referred to as requirement-aware load selection (RALS) policy to handle the contention of multiple applications that have various processing requirements but share the same computing resources. Based on RALS and PAR, we develop two scheduling algorithms: requirement-aware prudent algorithm with replication (RAPAR), and requirement-aware knowledge-free algorithm with replication (RAKAR). RAPAR and RAKAR address the scheduling of multiple BoT applications with heterogeneous processing requirements on Grids. RAPAR works in scenarios where inaccurate performance prediction information is provided whereas RAKAR works without any prediction information. Performance evaluation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our approaches when compared to existing algorithms.},

abstract={Mobile devices, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, have gained wide-spread popularity. These devices will increasingly be networked, thus enabling the construction of distributed applications that have to adapt to changes in context, such as variations in network bandwidth, battery power, connectivity, reachability of services and hosts, etc. In this paper, we describe CARISMA, a mobile computing middleware which exploits the principle of reflection to enhance the construction of adaptive and context-aware mobile applications. The middleware provides software engineers with primitives to describe how context changes should be handled using policies. These policies may conflict. We classify the different types of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing and argue that conflicts cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed, but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate a method by which policy conflicts can be handled; this method uses a microeconomic approach that relies on a particular type of sealed-bid auction. We describe how this method is implemented in the CARISMA middleware architecture and sketch a distributed context-aware application for mobile devices to illustrate how the method works in practice. We show, by way of a systematic performance evaluation, that conflict resolution does not imply undue overheads, before comparing our research to related work and concluding the paper.},

abstract={Software development is a complex endeavor that depends on a wide variety of contextual factors involving a large amount of distributed information such as technology-related tasks, software operating environments and stakeholder requirements. Most of this context is implicit and captured in the developers' minds (tacit) or distributed through volumes of documentation. Developers have to maintain mental models of this variety of tasks and information as they produce the software. As a result, context can be easily lost or forgotten and developers often use adhoc approaches while finishing the project. We present in this paper the preliminary results of a study that aims at analyzing qualitatively whether supporting software developers with a chatbot during task execution can improve the overall development experience. The chatbot can assist the developers in executing different tasks based on implicit contextual information. We propose an implementation to explore the viability of using textual chatbots to assist developers automatically and proactively with software development project activities that recur. We believe that understanding the interaction of developers with the systems supported by chatbots is key to improving the developer experience and advancing software engineering practices by providing needed timely support for developers.},

abstract={Botnets provide the foundation for a wide range of malicious activities on the Internet. Sophisticated Command and Control (C&C) infrastructures aim to prevent the detection and takedown of botnets and therefore pose a big challenge in the battle against network attacks of all kinds. In this paper, we present Chain Channels, a method for hidden botnet communication that exploits the digital signatures used in blockchains to inject subliminal messages. We show how subliminal messages can be included in signatures and distributed in blockchain transactions to the bots. We also show how the keying material required for extracting the subliminal information can be transmitted privately to the bots while being stored on a public blockchain. As proof of concept, we inject a subliminal message and a key in the Bitcoin blockchain and show how this information can be extracted from the transactions. Our method allows to establish a hidden C&C infrastructure over blockchains and send instructions to all bots without leaving any suspicious communication activities. The method relies only on digital signatures and is therefore applicable to numerous blockchains. The subliminal communication can not be distinguished from legitimate transactions, and mitigation would require redesigning blockchains to use new subliminal-free signature schemes. Our method provides a general hidden distribution channel over block chains and can be also applied to other scenarios where information needs to be transmitted covertly. It scales extremely well with the number of receivers (i.e., bots), and subliminal messages can even be distributed over different blockchains to exploit specific features of blockchains such as low transaction cost or fast confirmation times or to further obfuscate the existence of the C&C communication.},

abstract={Natural language question answering has been an area of active computer science research for decades. Recent advances have led to a new generation of virtual assistants or chatbots, frequently based on semantic modeling of some broadly general domain knowledge. However, answering questions about detailed, highly technical, domain-specific capabilities and attributes remains a difficult and complex problem. In this paper we discuss a prototype conversational virtual assistant designed for choosing test and measurement equipment based on the detailed measurement requirements of the test engineer. Our system allows for multi-stage queries which retain sufficient short-term context to support query refinement as well as compound questions. In addition to the software architecture, we explore an approach to ontology development that leverages inference from reasoners and minimizes the complexity of entering the specifications for a large collection of instruments. Finally, we provide insights into the issues of building this system and provide recommendations for future designs.},

abstract={The article discusses the current forms and channels of propaganda in the network space. Despite the fact that the methods and technologies of propaganda in its classic version are described in detail, in recent decades, the methods of propaganda influence have become more disguised and sophisticated: from the creation of bots in social networks to the fabrication of images and newspaper covers. In such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between true and false content, so the problem of selecting criteria for propaganda content is of particular importance today. The aim of the study is to identify the features of propaganda content in a digital society. The objectives of the research project include: the definition of “propaganda content” concept, the forms of its expression, the search for criteria to distinguish propaganda content from other types of information dissemination in social networks. The open materials of such programs as Hamilton 68, Digital Sherlocks, as well as the research of Computational Propaganda Worldwide conducted in Oxford were taken as an object. It is because of these and similar projects that the term “computer propaganda” is firmly entrenched in the scientific lexicon. The research methodology is based on the works of J. Bolsover, F. Howard, and a number of other foreign and domestic authors, indicating the following formats as components of promotional content in online communities: cyberattacks, bot farms, automatic distribution of posts on social networks, theft of data and disinformation. They are usually distributed simultaneously to maximize the coverage of the same information. The main methods of the study were case studies and content analysis. With their help, the case that caused social tension and long-term negative consequences (pension reform of 2018 in Russia) is considered. The analysis of the text format of information about this case, posted on social networks Facebook and Twitter, led to a number of conclusions: the methods used to identify propaganda content, require further serious study. The method of content analysis widely used for this purpose and the relatively recent method of intent analysis, due to the lack of the necessary methodology, are not always able to determine the availability of methods of propaganda influence. The results of the study allow us to state: computer propaganda in the modern world is very effective, including free or very inexpensive distribution. Moreover, the speed and the maximum number of users outreach by propaganda content become major issues. Today, social networks are a real arena of struggle, and the arsenal of propaganda means of influence is increasing exponentially. In these circumstances, the development of propaganda content identification methods can serve as a guarantor of success in the fight. This aspect is especially important in the long term, as in this way you can beat the competition and build the right communication strategy.},

abstract={Web robots are automated software agents primarily used for web searching and indexing. Nowadays, Web robots are frequently used for performing malicious (spamming and spying, etc.) activities on the internet because of their camouflage behavior. In web server logs it is difficult to identify the HTTP requests generated by these automated traverses due to circumventing identity. Unsupervised clustering methods may be useful for categorizing the HTTP user sessions into web robot and human sessions. In this paper, three clustering algorithms such as clustering large application (CLARA), ordering points to identify clustering (OPTICS) and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchy (BIRCH) are used to cluster the session data. The used clustering algorithms are considered from different categories such as Partition-Based, density-based and hierarchy-based respectively. The used algorithms are implemented in ELKI and JBIRCH open source libraries and applied on publicly available user session data. The comparative clustering performance of algorithms is done using cluster validity measures including Rand Index, Jaccard Index, and F-measure. The effective time taken by each measure for clustering web robot sessions and distinguishing from other three classes is also measured.},

abstract={In this work we introduce XBotCore (Cross-Bot-Core), a light-weight, Real-Time (RT) software platform for EtherCAT-based robots. XBotCore is open-source and is designed to be both an RT robot control framework and a software middleware. It satisfies hard RT requirements, while ensuring 1 kHz control loop even in complex Multi-Degree-Of-Freedom systems. It provides a simple and easy-to-use middleware Application Programming Interface (API), for both RT and non-RT control frameworks. This API is completely flexible with respect to the framework a user wants to utilize. Moreover it is possible to reuse the code written using XBotCore API with different robots (cross-robot feature). In this paper, the XBotCore design and architecture will be described and experimental results on the humanoid robot WALK-MAN [17], developed at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), will be presented.},

year={2017},
volume={43},

pages={701-714},
abstract={Existing static analysis tools require significant programmer effort. On large code bases, static analysis tools produce thousands of warnings. It is unrealistic to expect users to review such a massive list and to manually make changes for each warning. To address this issue we propose CCBot (short for CodeContracts Bot), a new tool that applies the results of static analysis to existing code through automatic code transformation. Specifically, CCBot instruments the code with method preconditions, postconditions, and object invariants which detect faults at runtime or statically using a static contract checker. The only configuration the programmer needs to perform is to give CCBot the file paths to code she wants instrumented. This allows the programmer to adopt contract-based static analysis with little effort. CCBot's instrumented version of the code is guaranteed to compile if the original code did. This guarantee means the programmer can deploy or test the instrumented code immediately without additional manual effort. The inserted contracts can detect common errors such as null pointer dereferences and out-of-bounds array accesses. CCBot is a robust large-scale tool with an open-source C# implementation. We have tested it on real world projects with tens of thousands of lines of code. We discuss several projects as case studies, highlighting undiscovered bugs found by CCBot, including 22 new contracts that were accepted by the project authors.},

abstract={From the end of 2007, the open-source characteristic of Android platform has been the most competitive one in the smart phone market. According to recent statistics from Gartner, Android's market share in February 2010 is 3.9%, rises to 17.2% in August in the same year, and reaches 22.7% in February 2011, which only falls behind Nokia's by 14.9%. From its skyrocketing growth rate, it can be expected that Google's Android operating system would become the dominate mobile platform. However, high market share comes with problems. For instance, in March 2011, Lookout, an information security company shows Dorid Dream will make the Android phones become the media of Bot Network. The ever-changing criminal conduct continuously challenges how well the present digital forensics could react. Data acquisition is an important part in mobile phone forensics. As the mobile forensic software becomes more mature and popular, most of them are now facing the same problem where the internal collecting tools must be installed in the mobile phones first so the data collecting could be started in turn. Whether this process is against the concept of protecting the original crime scene in forensics is questionable. A new concept called Live SD is therefore introduced in this work. It utilizes the concept of data recovery to perform physical data acquisition in Android smart phones. This data-acquisition methodology differs from the current ones in most mobile forensics software and can effectively perform the recovery of the deleted data.},

abstract={The widespread adoption of Internet of Things has led to many security issues. Post the Mirai-based DDoS attack in 2016 which compromised IoT devices, a host of new malware using Mirai's leaked source code and targeting IoT devices have cropped up, e.g. Satori, Reaper, Amnesia, Masuta etc. These malware exploit software vulnerabilities to infect IoT devices instead of open TELNET ports (like Mirai) making them more difficult to block using existing solutions such as firewalls. In this research, we present EDIMA, a distributed modular solution which can be used towards the detection of IoT malware network activity in large-scale networks (e.g. ISP, enterprise networks) during the scanning/infecting phase rather than during an attack. EDIMA employs machine learning algorithms for edge devices' traffic classification, a packet traffic feature vector database, a policy module and an optional packet sub-sampling module. We evaluate the classification performance of EDIMA through testbed experiments and present the results obtained.},

abstract={As the carrier of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) knowledge, API documentation plays a crucial role in how developers learn and use an API. It is also a valuable information resource for answering API-related questions, especially when developers cannot find reliable answers to their questions online/offline. However, finding answers to API-related questions from API documentation might not be easy because one may have to manually go through multiple pages before reaching the relevant page, and then read and understand the information inside the relevant page to figure out the answers. To deal with this challenge, we develop APIBot, a bot that can answer API questions given API documentation as an input. APIBot is built on top of SiriusQA, the QA system from Sirius, a state of the art intelligent personal assistant. To make SiriusQA work well under software engineering scenario, we make several modifications over SiriusQA by injecting domain specific knowledge. We evaluate APIBot on 92 API questions, answers of which are known to be present in Java 8 documentation. Our experiment shows that APIBot can achieve a Hit@5 score of 0.706.},

abstract={In a digital world, even illegal behaviour and/or crimes may be termed as digital. This world is increasing becoming mobile, where the basic computation and communication entities are Small Scale Digital Devices (SSDDs or S2D2s) such as ordinary mobile phones, personal digital assistants, smart phones and tablets. The need to recover data, which might refer to unlawful and unethical activities gave rise to the discipline of mobile forensics, which has become an integral part of digital forensics. Consequently, in the last few years there is an abundance of mobile forensics tools, both commercial and open-source ones, whose vendors and developers make various assertions about the capabilities and the performance of their tools. The complexity and the diversity of both mobile devices and mobile forensics tools, coupled with the volatile nature of the digital evidence and the legal requirements of admissibility makes it difficult for forensics investigators to select the right tool. Hence, we have evaluated UFED Physical Pro 1.1.3.8 and XRY 5.0 following “Smartphone Tool Specifications Standard” developed by NIST, in order to start developing a framework for evaluating and referencing the “goodness” of the mobile forensic tools. The experiments and the results of the research against the core smart phone tool specifications and their associated test findings are presented in such a way that it should make it easier for the prospective mobile forensic examiner select the most adequate tool for a specific case.},

abstract={We propose a system for helping individuals who follow a medical diet maintain this diet while visiting countries where a foreign language is spoken. Our focus is on diets where certain foods must either be restricted (e.g., metabolic diseases), avoided (e.g., food intolerance or allergies), or preferably consumed for medical reasons. However, our framework can be used to manage other diets (e.g., vegan) as well. The system is based on the use of a hand-held multimedia device such as a PDA or mobile telephone to analyze and/or disambiguate the content of foods offered on restaurant menus and interpret them in the context of specific diets. The system also provides the option to communicate diet-related instructions or information to a local person (e.g., a waiter) as well as obtain clarifications through dialogue. All computations are performed within the device and do not require a network connection. Real-time text translation is a challenge. We address this challenge with a light-weight, context-specific machine translation method. This method builds on a modification of existing open source Machine Translation (MT) software to obtain a fast and accurate translation. In particular, we describe a method we call n-gram consolidation that joins words in a language pair and increases the accuracy of the translation. We developed and implemented this system on the iPod Touch for English speakers traveling in Spain. Our tests indicate that our translation method yields the correct translation more often than general purpose translation engines such as Google Translate, and does so almost instantaneously. The memory requirements of the application, including the database of picture, are also well within the limits of the device.},

abstract={Domestic and industrial robots, intelligent software agents, virtual-world avatars, and other artificial entities are being created and deployed in our society for various routine and hazardous tasks, as well as for entertainment and companionship. Over the past ten years or so, primarily in response to the growing security threats and financial fraud, it has become necessary to accurately authenticate the identities of human beings using biometrics. For similar reasons, it may become essential to determine the identities of nonbiological entities. Trust and security issues associated with the large-scale deployment of military soldier-robots [55], robot museum guides [22], software office assistants [24], human like biped robots [67], office robots [5], domestic and industrial androids [93], [76], bots [85], robots with humanlike faces [60], virtual-world avatars [109], and thousands of other man-made entities require the development of methods for a decentralized, affordable, automatic, fast, secure, reliable, and accurate means of authenticating these artificial agents. The approach has to be decentralized to allow authority-free authentication important for open-source and collaborative societies. To address these concerns, we proposed [117], [120], [119], [38] the concept of artimetricsa field of study that identifies, classifies, and authenticates robots, software, and virtual reality agents. In this article, unless otherwise qualified, the term robot refers to both embodied robots (industrial, mobile, tele, personal, military, and service) and virtual robots or avatars, focusing specifically on those that have a human morphology.},

abstract={In the modern world of automation, image processing finds applications majorly in environment mapping, navigation, and localization. One of the most primitive methods of navigation on a fixed path is by using line detection and following. This is often performed using infrared or visible light-based sensor arrays that provide feedback based on the intensity of light reflected from the surface. These sensing methods produce inaccurate measurements when used on uneven surfaces and place limitations on the distance between the sensor and surfaces. In this paper, we present an efficient setup for pose estimation of a robot using image processing for line-following applications. The implementation is based on an open-source system and supporting libraries. It uses Canny edge detection for detecting line edges, with optimizations to adapt for different lighting conditions and a wide range of coloured lanes. The implementation removes many shortcomings associated with the traditional methods but at the cost of reduced error measurement frequency.},

abstract={We introduce a novel two-stage approach for the important cybersecurity problem of detecting the presence of a botnet and identifying the compromised nodes (the bots), ideally before the botnet becomes active. The first stage detects anomalies by leveraging large deviations of an empirical distribution. We propose two approaches to create the empirical distribution: 1) a flow-based approach estimating the histogram of quantized flows and 2) a graph-based approach estimating the degree distribution of node interaction graphs, encompassing both Erdös-Rényi graphs and scale-free graphs. The second stage detects the bots using ideas from social network community detection in a graph that captures correlations of interactions among nodes over time. Community detection is performed by maximizing a modularity measure in this graph. The modularity maximization problem is nonconvex. We propose a convex relaxation, an effective randomization algorithm, and establish sharp bounds on the suboptimality gap. We apply our method to real-world botnet traffic and compare its performance with other methods.},

abstract={There has been a fundamental shift amongst software developers and engineers in the past few years. The software development life cycle (SDLC) for a developer has increased in complexity and scale. Changes that were developed and deployed over a matter of days or weeks are now deployed in a matter of hours. Due to greater availability of compute, storage, better tooling, and the necessity to react, developers are constantly looking to increase their velocity and throughput of developing and deploying changes. Consequently, there is a great need for more intelligent and context sensitive DevOps tools and services that help developers increase their efficiency while developing and debugging. Given the vast amounts of heterogeneous data available from the SDLC, such intelligent tools and services can now be built and deployed at a large scale to help developers achieve their goals and be more productive. In this paper, we present Sankie, a scalable and general service that has been developed to assist and impact all stages of the modern SDLC. Sankie provides all the necessary infrastructure (back-end and front-end bots) to ingest data from repositories and services, train models based on the data, and eventually perform decorations or provide information to engineers to help increase the velocity and throughput of changes, bug fixes etc. This paper discusses the architecture as well as some of the key observations we have made from wide scale deployment of Sankie within Microsoft.},

abstract={The two greatest disincentives to offering engineering courses in "distance" mode are the additional effort required for faculty to prepare and deliver the materials and the concurrent loss of the immediate feedback the instructor receives in a typical classroom environment. An "online" offering of a course typically increases the faculty effort by a factor of four to six and, without costly broadband communications equipment and operating personnel, it is difficult for students to ask questions of the instructor or the instructor to poll or quiz the students. Without these features, much of what is called "distance-learning" today can be distilled to nothing more than watching recorded video and definitely not the desired "learning community" experience of the contemporary engineering classroom. Silicon Chalktrade is collaborative software designed to enhance the face-to-face experience, allow for and encourage participation of remote students, record the entire process, and make it available to students involved synchronously and asynchronously while eliminating, almost entirely, the additional staff and equipment overhead traditionally required. This paper discusses a Silicon Chalktrade pilot project in progress at Virginia Tech},

abstract={Nowadays, many services in the internet including Email, search engine, social networking are provided with free of charge due to enormous growth of web users. With the expansion of Web services, denial of service (DoS) attacks by malicious automated programs (e.g., web bots) is becoming a serious problem of web service accounts. A HIP, or Human Interactive Proofs, is a human authentication mechanism that generates and grades tests to determine whether the user is a human or a malicious computer program. Unfortunately, the existing HIPs tried to maximize the difficulty for automated programs to pass tests by increasing distortion or noise. Consequently, it has also become difficult for potential users too. So there is a tradeoff between the usability and robustness in designing HIP tests. In our proposed technique we tried to balance the readability and security by adding contextual information in the form of natural conversation without reducing the distortion and noise. In the result section, a microscopic large-scale user study was conducted involving 110 users to investigate the actual user views compare to existing state of the art CAPTCHA systems like Google's reCAPTCHA and Microsoft's CAPTCHA in terms of usability and security and found our system capable of deploying largely over internet.},

Usability requirements can be considered to be requirements that capture the usability goals and associated measures for a system under development. In order to ensure usable systems we must ensure identification of appropriate requirements regarding these critical aspects of systems. There is a basic need for systematic approaches to reason, model and analyze usability from the early stages of the software development. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop a usable ontology or classification of measurable aspects of usability that can be used to aid in the specification of usability requirements. These ontologies should be represented in a way that facilitates their use as guidelines for the requirements elicitation process. We build on review of literature in the area of human-computer interaction and of usability engineering in developing a catalog of aspects of usability that can be considered during requirements gathering. This catalogue is used to guide the requirements engineer through alternatives for achieving usability. The approach is based on the use of the i* framework, having usability modeled as a special type of goal.},

abstract={Model Based Software Engineering (MBSE) consists in applying Model-Based Engineering principles - mostly abstraction and automation - to software engineering practices. As concluded by several empirical studies during the past 10 years, applying MBSE methodology is no more a question and we shall now wonder how to do it rather than if we should. One of the major criticisms of MBSE remains about the available tooling to apply its methodology. Multiple surveys show that the usability of tools and the lack of skills from the user are two key barriers that still slow down the spread of the MBSE approach. In the meantime, these surveys also highlight the difficulties software engineers often encounter during the modeling activity itself, regardless of the tool. Indeed, complex operations such as problem-to-model mapping, consistency checking or error identification are still often manually performed by humans. The recent advances in AIs introduced new software-based systems able to interact with their users to help them in their daily life. The purpose of this PhD is to investigate how such AIs (which we will call software assistants) could help software engineers to face the complexity of software modeling. Interactions between software assistants and users of MBSE tools will be the bulk of this work. We plan to implement software assistants and provide them an access to a high-quality knowledge repository on models that we will build to study these interactions. Based on these studies, we hope to contribute laying the foundations of interactions with software assistants. The end result will feature a knowledge repository and a Software Assistant acting together to help users modeling by catering for new ideas, recommendations and help. This work will also provide frameworks to create knowledge repositories and IDE-embedded software assistants.},

abstract={As Web services and the semantic Web become more important, enabling technologies such as Web service ontologies will grow larger. The ability of mobile devices, such as cell phones and PDAs, to download and reason across them will be severely limited. Given that an agent on a mobile device only needs a subset of what is described in a Web service ontology, an ontology sub-graph can be created. In this paper, we develop a empirical software engineering approach to build a prediction model to measure the quality in terms of correct query handling of ontology sub-graphs relative to the original ontology - mean average recall of the sub-graph compared to the original ontology is used as the quality standard. Our metrics allow speedy selection of a sub-graph for use by a mobile device.},

This project is focused on the performance evaluation of WiMAX and WiFi systems. It is conducted using open source simulator called NCTUns 6.0. Several scenarios have been created, to evaluate the coexistence of WiMAX and WiFi technology. The data of the simulation results have been gathered and the performance with the effects of transport layer protocol, send rates, packet sizes, distances, bandwidth and queue length were analyzed. Based on the results obtained, the performance of both WiMAX and WiFi technology are not affected due to distances variation but its performance can be improved by using of other parameter such as packet size, bandwidth and queue length.},

Yet other attacks target cyber-physical systems whose compromise could potentially lead to the injury or death of individuals relying on or nearby the equipment.

This paper aims to provide guidance by explaining the requirements of the standard, demonstrating proper test methods, analyzing real-world test results, and discussing significant factors affecting compliance. Experimental results and lessons-learned are presented for modern industrial lead acid battery charge systems. Although charger hardware conversion efficiency is important, the software algorithm is at least as important, as is the efficiency of the battery itself, and the system interconnections and cabling. Some charger topologies and battery types will struggle to comply with the standard, and may be displaced by more efficient technologies.},

abstract={Botnets are a class of internet attacks having different characteristics as compared to the normal internet attacks. One of the features that uniquely characterize a botnet attack is that "the infected machine (Bot) is being remotely controlled by an entity called "Botmaster". The Botmaster remotely controls these infected systems through "Command and Control" servers (C&C). Over a period of time complexity of botnets has increased many folds. Advance techniques employed by botnets such as protocol encryption, complex botnet structure and multi stage infection propagation models have made the botnets detection a challenging problem. Hence there is a need of a botnet detection mechanism which is independent of C&C protocol, structure and the infection propagation model used by the botnet. In the work presented in this paper, the experiments have been performed for evaluating the strength of existing botnet detection techniques, and proposed an advance detection mechanism which uses a logical combination of existing open source solutions with Honeynet technologies and our own mechanisms for botnets detection. A test setup as a proof-of-concept of the proposed framework with the experimental results is presented in this paper.},

abstract={The attacks on various networks by intruders is on the rise and one of the most common model for launching attacks is by botnets. It has become very difficult for network administrators to detect and eradicate the bots in their network. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used for solving many classification problems including security systems for cloud. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for the detection of botnet traffic by the use of neuro-fuzzy classification techniques. The dataset for the experimentation purpose was created by setting up an application on Eucalyptus cloud and attacking the application using various open source botnet simulation tools. The system achieved an accuracy of 94.78% with 15,000 instances and 56 attributes. The false positives of the system are considerably reduced when it is compared with the other related systems because of the introduction of the fuzzy rules into the system.},

abstract={SIP-based Voice Over IP(VoIP) network is becoming predominant in current and future communications. Distributed Denial of service attacks pose a serious threat to VOIP network security. SIP servers are victims of DDos attacks. The major aim of the DDos attacks is to avoid legitimate users to access resources of SIP servers. Distributed Denial of service attacks target the VOIP network by deploying bots at different locations by injecting malformed packets and even they halt the entire VOIP service causes degradation of QoS(Quality of Service). DDos attacks are easy to launch and quickly drain computational resources of VOIP network and nodes. Detecting DDos attacks is a challenging and extremely difficult due to its varying strategy and scope of attackers. Many DDos detection and prevention schemes are deployed in VOIP networks but they are not complete working in both realtime and offline modes. They are inefficient in detecting dynamic and low-rate DDos attacks and even fail when the attack is launched by simultaneously manipulating multiple SIP attributes. In this paper we propose a novel scheme based on Hellinger distance(HD) to detect low-rate and multi-attribute DDos attacks. Usually DDos detection and mitigations schemes are implemented in SIP proxy. But we leverage the SIP load balancer to fight against DDos by using existing load balancing features. We have implemented the proposed scheme by modifying leading open source kamailio SIP proxy server. We have evaluated our scheme by experimental test setup and found results are outperforming the existing DDos prevention schemes in terms of detection rate, system overhead and false-positive alarms.},

abstract={In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), models are used to build and analyze complex systems. In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring. Research challenges for the proposed framework are discussed and a research roadmap is presented.},

We introduce a multi-dimensional view of context based on perception and influence, replacing the typical one-dimensional view. To realize the dynamic behaviour of contextual elements we use a 2×2 matrix to represent four contextual states. The contextual states are a result of either contextual/noncontextual influence(s), or explicit/implicit perception(s). We demonstrate the usefulness of our method through a case-study for requirements developed for a system which marks voters electronically using handheld PDA devices. The requirements are analysed and modelled using focal points, context-centres, and context maps.},

abstract={Virtual conversational assistants designed specifically for software engineers could have a huge impact on the time it takes for software engineers to get help. Research efforts are focusing on virtual assistants that support specific software development tasks such as bug repair and pair programming. In this paper, we study the use of online chat platforms as a resource towards collecting developer opinions that could potentially help in building opinion Q&A systems, as a specialized instance of virtual assistants and chatbots for software engineers. Opinion Q&A has a stronger presence in chats than in other developer communications, thus mining them can provide a valuable resource for developers in quickly getting insight about a specific development topic (e.g., What is the best Java library for parsing JSON?). We address the problem of opinion Q&A extraction by developing automatic identification of opinion-asking questions and extraction of participants' answers from public online developer chats. We evaluate our automatic approaches on chats spanning six programming communities and two platforms. Our results show that a heuristic approach to opinion-asking questions works well (.87 precision), and a deep learning approach customized to the software domain outperforms heuristics-based, machine-learning-based and deep learning for answer extraction in community question answering.},

We can use them for example for selecting the most suitable old electrical devices in electrical distribution networks, which we need to replace by a new devices, which fall under the system of remote control and monitoring networks. The application of these remote-controlled devices causes acceleration in handling and thus shortening of duration of a fault in the electrical networks. This results in rising of probability of faultless service and thus the reliability of electrical energy supply. We cannot replace all old devices, because the price of these devices is very high.

abstract={In hybrid internetworks, the plurality of service options and compositions poses several cross-layer operational challenges. The growing popularity of such internetworks among researchers and advanced users - many of which are grid users - warrants a complexity relief effort in support of the internetworks' continued scalability, all the way to planet scale. This paper proposes the use of semantic Web techniques to automate the processing of networking meta-data in a hybrid internetwork, with the two-fold outcome of raising the degree of confidence in the internetwork and lowering its operating costs. By virtue of latching onto the semantic Web curve, a new breed of power tools - bots, compilers, browsers - will be delivering on the aforementioned outcomes, while fully leveraging COTS and open source building blocks. Furthermore, the investment in the semantic Web is thought to future proof a hybrid internetwork and readies it for times when service metrics other than connectivity (e.g., resiliency, protocol transparency, security etc.) will be evaluated end-to-end. The approach appears to be applicable to the global lambda integrated facility (GLIF) as well as other advanced, experimental communities},

abstract={Even if hardware improvements have increased the performance of embedded systems in the last years, resource problems are still acute. The persisting problem is the constantly growing complexity of systems. New devices for service such as PDAs or smartphones increase the need for flexible and adaptive open software. Component-based software engineering tries to address these problems and one key point for development is the Quality of Service (QoS) coming from resource constraints. In this paper, we recall the concepts behind Qinna, a component-based QoS Architecture, which was designed to manage QoS issues, and we illustrate the developpement of a image viewer application within this framework. We focus on the general developpement methodology of resource-aware applications with Qinna framework, from the specification of resource constraints to the use of generic Qinnapsilas algorithms for negotiating QoS contracts at runtime.},

abstract={To develop a reliable statistical classifiers of Java source code patterns, a feature space has to be developed and thoroughly examined as there are little general recommendations, such as in the field of image processing. This paper deals with development and evaluation of such feature space. Current version of feature space consisting of four categories and forty features is presented. Moreover, since feature collection from a source code is a non-trivial task, method of data acquisition with help of newly constructed domain specific language is given. Another issue that has to be solved is determination of structure of particular patterns, as their implementation can vary with different software projects. Straightforward patterns may have little explanatory power for project's architecture, however it could be demanding to detect more abstract ones. In addition, the proposed patterns should meet standards recognized by the software engineering community.},

abstract={The ability to think has been one of the most fascinating features of robots in science fiction since the introduction of the word 'robot' by Karel Capek in his Czech science fiction play, known as 'Rossum's Universal Robots' in English [1]. Since Capek's first depiction in 1921, science fictionists generally portray robots as intelligent humanoid machines that are subservient to humans. Android is another term used for such robots in modern linguistics. However, the development of robots with the ability to think has largely been a fantasy for robot scientists and engineers. Nevertheless, the evolution of robots has come a long way since the first industrial robot 'Unimate' in 1954. Robots have transformed from large automated manufacturing facilities to applications in our homes and even into our pockets as software robots in our PDAs and smart phones [2], [3]. This paper classifies robot intelligence into six categories: cognitive intelligence, social intelligence, behavioral intelligence, ambient intelligence, collective intelligence and genetic intelligence. This classification categorizes the intelligence of robots based on the different aspects of awareness and the ability to act deliberately as a result of such awareness.},

To address these challenges applications have to be adaptive. We describe mobile computing and its constraints. We describe adaptation spaces as a common framework for understanding the state-of-the-art in adaptive applications. A number of projects are reviewed and discussed. Then, a new rising paradigm in building adaptive applications is introduced based on a component-based architecture.

abstract={Combining static and dynamic information is highly relevant in many reverse engineering, program comprehension and maintenance tasks. To allow dynamic information reflecting software system usage scenarios, it should be collected during a long period of time, in a real user environment. This, however, poses several challenges. First and foremost, it is necessary to model the extraction of any relevant dynamic information from execution traces, thus avoiding to collect a large amount of unmanageable data. Second, we need a distributed architecture that allows to collect and compress such an information from geographically distributed users. We propose a probabilistic model for representing dynamic information, as well as a Web-service based distributed architecture for its collection and compression. The new architecture has been instantiated to collect inter-procedural program execution traces up to a selectable level of calling context sensitivity. The paper details the role and responsibilities of the architecture components, as well as performance and compression ratios achieved on a set of C and Java programs.},

pages={680-685},
abstract={In today's IoT smart environments, dozens of MCU-based connected device types exist such as HVAC controllers, smart meters, smoke detectors, etc. The security conditions for these essential IoT devices remain unsatisfactory since: (i) many of them are built with cost as the driving design tenet, resulting in poor configurations and open design; (ii) their memory and computational resource constraints make it highly challenging to implement practical attack protection mechanisms; and (iii) currently, manufacturers use simplified light protocol versions to save memory for extra features (to boost sales). When such issues and vulnerabilities are exploited, devices can be compromised and converted into bots whereby severe DDoS attacks can be launched by a botmaster. Such tiny devices are safe only when connected to networks with defense mechanisms installed in their networking devices like routers and switches, which might not be present everywhere, e.g. on public/free Wi-Fi networks. To safeguard tiny IoT devices from cyberattacks, we provide resource-friendly standalone attack detection models termed Edge2Guard (E2G) that enable MCU-based IoT devices to instantly detect IoT attacks without depending on networks or any external protection mechanisms. During evaluation, our top-performing E2G models detected and classified ten types of Mirai and Bashlite malware with close to 100% detection rates.},

abstract={A framework of Internet Protocol (IP)-based service overlay networks is described and context-aware [e.g., such as required Quality of Service (QoS) level; type of service such as real time versus data; nature of data stream such as l-frame versus B-frame; and type of terminal such as TV monitor versus personal digital assistant], dynamically adaptive (e.g., using locally derived information to discover, organize, and maintain traffic flows in the network within a local area network), and self-organizing networking capabilities (e.g., developing network structures based on the needs of the customers and the capabilities of existing network structures), including advanced routing and forwarding schemes, that are independent of underlying networks, are specified in this Next Generation Service Overlay Network (NGSON) standard. The NGSON architecture provides advanced service- and transport-related functions to support context-aware, dynamically adaptive, and self-organizing networks. This standard specifies a functional architecture for NGSON. The functional architecture consists of a set of functional entities (FEs), their functions, reference points, and information flows to illustrate service interaction and media delivery among FEs and external components. NGSON may operate with different underlying networks such as IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), next generation network (NGN), peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay, or Web to transmit NGSON signaling messages and/or media among its users and services. Specifications of underlying networks are outside scope of this standard.},

year={2015},
volume={},

pages={69-80},
abstract={Over the last decade botnets survived by adopting a sequence of increasingly sophisticated strategies to evade detection and take overs, and to monetize their infrastructure. At the same time, the success of privacy infrastructures such as Tor opened the door to illegal activities, including botnets, ransomware, and a marketplace for drugs and contraband. We contend that the next waves of botnets will extensively attempt to subvert privacy infrastructure and cryptographic mechanisms. In this work we propose to preemptively investigate the design and mitigation of such botnets. We first, introduce OnionBots, what we believe will be the next generation of resilient, stealthy botnets. OnionBots use privacy infrastructures for cyber attacks by completely decoupling their operation from the infected host IP address and by carrying traffic that does not leak information about its source, destination, and nature. Such bots live symbiotically within the privacy infrastructures to evade detection, measurement, scale estimation, observation, and in general all IP-based current mitigation techniques. Furthermore, we show that with an adequate self-healing network maintenance scheme, that is simple to implement, OnionBots can achieve a low diameter and a low degree and be robust to partitioning under node deletions. We develop a mitigation technique, called SOAP, that neutralizes the nodes of the basic OnionBots. In light of the potential of such botnets, we believe that the research community should proactively develop detection and mitigation methods to thwart OnionBots, potentially making adjustments to privacy infrastructure.},

year={2015},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Offshore Wind Farms are very expensive assets, not only to design and build, but also to operate and maintain. Their remote location, coupled with weather's constraints and harsh marine environment, and the lack of adapted access equipment, make their maintenance complicated and expensive due to high repair costs, high transportations costs and painful production losses due to high downtime. More generally, the offshore wind technology is in a stage of development where its economic worthiness has still to be fully demonstrated, and numerous projects are largely supported by governmental subsidies. This lack of maturity is evident, for example, through the numerous reliability problems of wind turbines components. Both the inherent aspects of the offshore wind industry and the reliability problems it is facing contribute to the high Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs and eventually hinder its competitiveness compared to other sources of energy. It is commonly assumed that up to 25 % of the cost of energy produced by offshore wind turbines is due to O&M activities, which is twice as expensive as onshore installations. This paper describes a methodology to optimize the maintenance strategy of offshore wind farms in order to minimize life cycle costs and maximize availability and performance. The ApmOptimizer, developed by BQR Reliability Engineering is the software tool used for modelling, reliability analysis, cost and performance estimations and maintenance optimization. For the purpose of the demonstration, a case study of a typical wind farm is defined. A detailed model is built that accounts for numerous operational, cost and maintenance parameters. The ApmOptimizer optimization modules are then implemented for optimizing the preventive maintenance, periodical inspections, condition-based maintenance, and spares levels. Starting from a baseline scenario, several optimization steps are investigated, following a typical RAM/LCC analysis assessment procedure: Operational Availability, Operational Downtime, Lifecycle O&M Costs and produced Energy are used as the main metrics. The optimal maintenance strategy is obtained from an exact optimization process and not from Monte Carlo simulations that can provide only an approximate assessment for a user-inputted strategy. The study shows that by following several optimization steps, the wind farm performances can be significantly increased, to a level that makes the cost of produced energy more competitive. The influence of modelling parameters like failure distribution and degradation process is also investigated.},

abstract={A well-designed software API is like an ATM: convenient, efficient, and secure. For like an automated teller machine, a good API (application program interface) is an around-the-clock source of goodies to those who present the right inputs. APIs, like ATMs, allow their users to access a host of services that were once the sole preserve of human operators, such as, in the case of banks, paying a bill, requesting a checkbook, obtaining a balance, or moving funds between accounts. But ATMs, like banks, do not operate on the honor principle. Rather, they require users to first obtain a valid account and present valid credentials whenever they seek access to sensitive services. A secure API also requires its users to first register for a named or numbered account and offer appropriate tokens of proof—the API version of a pin code—before they can access the goodies. When it comes to registering Twitterbots, which, it must be said, are autonomous systems with great potential for mischief, Twitter is no look-the-other-way Swiss bank. So in this chapter, we walk through the necessary steps to set up a Twitter account and register a new application. It may seem a touch ironic that our bots need the permission and support of the Twitter API to play their subversive games online.1 But once this necessary bureaucracy is quickly dealt with, we can move on to the altogether more interesting topic of how best to exploit the API, first by building a reusable launch platform for sending our bots into the Twittersphere and then by designing our own free-flying Twitterbots.},

abstract={As institutions of higher education attempt to professionalize their curricula, we observe the emergence of learning experiences that simulate industrial software projects and stronger focus on the skill set desired by the industry. A common practice to address that need is to introduce a capstone unit where students complete large assignments in teams and consolidate previously acquired concepts and skills. Increasingly, such projects are supported by a given software development methodology in order to familiarize students with these processes and facilitate implementation. While the growing prevalence of Agile methods in the industry is reflected in a proliferation of studies of their use in academic contexts, the application of traditional approaches does not capture much attention in research. This experience report discusses the introduction of a Waterfall model to support student teams developing Artificial Conversational Entities for an industrial client. The course structure and accompanying methods, adaptations of the process, lessons learned and recommendations for academics wishing to use a traditional method as part of a university class are presented. Our study shows that such an approach yields promising results for complex and state-of-the-art projects and practices associated with it enforce students' software-engineering skills.},

abstract={Model-Driven Software Engineering encompasses various modelling formalisms for supporting software development. One such formalism is domain modelling which bridges the gap between requirements expressed in natural language and analyzable and more concise domain models expressed in class diagrams. Due to the lack of modelling skills among novice modellers and time constraints in industrial projects, it is often not possible to build an accurate domain model manually. To address this challenge, we aim to develop an approach to extract domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language by combining rules based on natural language processing with machine learning. As a first step, we report on an automated and tool-supported approach with an accuracy of extracted domain models higher than existing approaches. In addition, the approach generates trace links for each model element of a domain model. The trace links enable novice modellers to execute queries on the extracted domain models to gain insights into the modelling decisions taken for improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, to evaluate our approach, we propose a novel comparison metric and discuss our experimental design. Finally, we present a research agenda detailing research directions and discuss corresponding challenges.},

abstract={Software developers today crave for feedback, be it from their peers or even bots in the form of code review, static analysis tools like their compiler, or the local or remote execution of their tests in the Continuous Integration (CI) environment. With the advent of social coding sites like GitHub and tight integration of CI services like Travis CI, software development practices have fundamentally changed. Despite a highly changed software engineering landscape, however, we still lack a suitable description of an individual's contemporary software development practices, that is how an individual code contribution comes to be. Existing descriptions like the v-model are either too coarse-grained to describe an individual contributor's workflow, or only regard a sub-part of the development process like Test-Driven Development. In addition, most existing models are prerather than de-scriptive. By contrast, in our thesis, we perform a series of empirical studies to describe the individual constituents of Feedback-Driven Development (FDD) and then compile the evidence into an initial theory on how modern software development works. Our thesis culminates in the finding that feedback loops are the characterizing criterion of contemporary software development. Our model is flexible enough to accommodate a broad bandwidth of contemporary workflows, despite large variances in how projects use and configure parts of FDD.},

abstract={Smartphones are the latest technology trend of the 21st century. Today's social expectation of always staying connected and the need for an increase in productivity are the reasons for the increase in smartphone usage. One of the leaders of the smartphone evolution is Google's Android Operating System (OS). The openness of the design and the ease of customizing are the aspects that are placing Android ahead of the other smartphone OSs. Such popularity has not only led to an increase in Android usage but also to the rise of Android malware. Although such malware is not having a significant impact on the popularity of Android smartphones, it is however creating new possibilities for threats. One such threat is the impact of botnets on Android smartphones. Recently, malware has surfaced that revealed specific characteristics relating to traditional botnet activities. Malware such as Geinimi, Pjapps, DroidDream, and RootSmart all display traditional botnet functionalities. These malicious applications show that Android botnets is a reality. From a security perspective it is important to understand the underlying structure of an Android botnet. This paper evaluates Android malware with the purpose of identifying specific trends and characteristics relating to botnet behaviour. The botnet trends and characteristics are detected by a comprehensive literature study of well-known Android malware applications. The identified characteristics are then further explored in terms of the Android Botnet Development Model and the Android Botnet Discovery Process. The common identified trends and characteristics aid the understanding of Android botnet activities as well as the possible discovery of an Android bot.},

year={2006},
volume={49},

pages={254-262},
abstract={This paper describes the process of review, design, and delivery of a course in modern embedded systems, an international collaborative teaching project involving the University of New South Wales (Australia), Manchester University, and Imperial College, London University (United Kingdom). This project, being the first of its kind anywhere in the world, provides a learning environment that replicates the current industrial practice in embedded systems design in an easy and comprehensible setting, an environment where the processor, dedicated coprocessors, and software are all integrated to create a functional system such as used in sophisticated electronic devices, including mobile phones, Web phones, televisions, digital cameras, and personal digital assistants. Such collaborations are important in both reducing development costs in developing up-to-date, and increasingly sophisticated, courses and in addressing pedagogical issues that are common between computer and electrical engineering programs in all academic institutions. To assist students' learning experience, the course is supported with purpose built state-of-the-art programmable hardware and software development platforms, carefully planned laboratory experiments, lecture notes, weekly online quizzes, tutorials, and a companion CD-ROM as a learning tool. Since the introduction of this complete package, students' satisfaction, assessment results, and skills obtained through evaluation and assessment methods have improved markedly},

pages={7152-7169},
abstract={The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a considerable and long-lasting social and economic impact on the world. Along with other potential challenges across different domains, it has brought numerous cybersecurity challenges that must be tackled timely to protect victims and critical infrastructure. Social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats are one of the major methods for creating turmoil, especially by targeting critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and healthcare services. Social engineering-based cyber-attacks are based on the use of psychological and systematic techniques to manipulate the target. The objective of this research study is to explore the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice social engineering-based techniques, attack methods, and platforms used for conducting such cybersecurity attacks and threats. We undertake a systematically directed Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) related to the recent upsurge in social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 52 primary studies were selected from both formal and grey literature based on the established quality assessment criteria. As an outcome of this research study; we discovered that the major social engineering-based techniques used during the COVID-19 pandemic are phishing, scamming, spamming, smishing, and vishing, in combination with the most used socio-technical method: fake emails, websites, and mobile apps used as weapon platforms for conducting successful cyber-attacks. Three types of malicious software were frequently used for system and resource exploitation are; ransomware, trojans, and bots. We also emphasized the economic impact of cyber-attacks performed on different organizations and critical infrastructure in which hospitals and healthcare were on the top targeted infrastructures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, we identified the open challenges, general recommendations, and prospective solutions for future work from the researcher and practitioner communities by using the latest technology, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data analytics.},

year={2019},
volume={},
number={},
pages={329-336},
abstract={Ten years after its first release, the Robot Operating System (ROS) is arguably the most popular software framework used to program robots. It achieved such status despite its shortcomings compared to alternatives similarly centered on manual programming and, perhaps surprisingly, to model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches. Based on our experience as users and developers of both ROS and MDE tools, we identified possible ways to leverage the accessibility of ROS and its large software ecosystem, while providing quality assurance measures through selected MDE techniques. After describing our vision on how to combine MDE and manually written code, we present the first technical contribution in this pursuit: a family of three metamodels to respectively model ROS nodes, communication interfaces, and systems composed from subsystems. Such metamodels can be used, through the accompanying Eclipse-based tooling made publicly available, to model ROS systems of arbitrary complexity and generate with correctness guarantees the software artifacts for their composition and deployment. Furthermore, they account for specifications on these aspects by the Object Management Group (OMG), in order to be amenable to hybrid systems coupling ROS and other frameworks. We also report on our experience with a large and complex corpus of ROS software used in a commercially deployed robot (the Care-O-bot 4), to explain the rationale of the presented work, including the shortcomings of standard ROS tools and of previous efforts on ROS modeling.},

abstract={The demand for graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) has steadily increased in recent decades. In the United States alone, jobs for biomedical engineers are expected to increase by 62% by 2020, and jobs in software development and medical science are expected to increase by 32% and 36%, respectively. Combined with an insufficient number of students enrolled in STEM fields, this will result in about 2.4 million STEM job vacancies by 2018. Therefore, increasing the number of STEM graduates is currently a national priority for many governments worldwide. An effective way to engage young minds in STEM disciplines is to introduce robotic kits into primary and secondary education. The most widely used robotic kits, such as LEGO Mindstorm, VEX Robotics, and Fischertechnik, are composed of libraries of prefabricated parts that are not interoperable among kits from different vendors. As recently surveyed in Kee, alternatives to these popular kits are either highly modular but very expensive (e.g., Kondo, Bioloid, Cubelets, K-Junior V2, and Kephera) and unaffordable for the majority of schools, or single-configuration and lowcost robots (e.g., AERObot, iRobot, and Boe-Bot) with a restricted number of activities possible. An affordable solution that provides a number of interchangeable modules is littleBits. This platform offers a variety of sensing and actuation modules that use magnets to connect, but it lacks programmability, thus limiting students' ability to learn about coding.},

pages={163-185},
abstract={Many producers and consumers of legacy training simulator and game environments are beginning to envision a new era where psycho-socio-physiologic models could be interoperated to enhance their environments' simulation of human agents. This paper explores whether we could embed our behavior modeling framework (described in the companion paper, Part 1) behind a legacy first person shooter 3D game environment to recreate portions of the Black Hawk Down scenario. Section 1 amplifies the interoperability needs and challenges confronting the field, presents the questions that are examined, and describes the test scenario. Sections 2 and 3 review the software and knowledge engineering methodology, respectively, needed to create the system and populate it with bots. Results (Section 4) and discussion (Section 5) reveal that we were able to generate plausible and adaptive recreations of Somalian crowds, militia, women acting as shields, suicide bombers, and more. Also, there are specific lessons learned about ways to advance the field so that such interoperabilities will become more affordable and widespread.},

abstract={The topic of collaborative modeling has long been relevant in software. Collaborative facilities are part and parcel of modeling tools, and every day hundreds of thousands of developers engage in collaborative modeling of some sort. This theme issue contains four articles spanning a variety of areas in collaborative modeling. The first article offers a somewhat classic approach to handling collaborative-design conflicts. The second one addresses securely sharing only parts of a collaborative model. The third discusses whether distance still matters in collaborative design. The fourth introduces a timely approach to collaborative modeling through chatbots.},

year={2005},

pages={18-20},
abstract={Viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and network intrusions are among the threats that security administrators worry about on a regular basis. However, there is a less familiar threat that many experts say could be just as dangerous: malicious bot software. A bot is a program that operates automatically as an agent for a user or another program. Hackers forward bots to victims by a number of means, and the software automatically infects vulnerable computers. The bots then wait for commands from a hacker, who can manipulate them and the infected systems without the user's knowledge. A hacker can install bots on multiple computers to set up botnets that they can use for massive distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm victimized systems' defenses. Botnets can also be used for mass spam mailings, installing key-logging software that can steal victims' passwords and data, and compromising computers to prepare them for infection by future viruses.},

abstract={DESPITE BEING a main player in the development of software architecture for the smartphone, David Wood prefers to describe himself as the chair of the London Futurists, a meet-up group dedicated to seriously discussing a range of 'desirable outcomes' for society. The world of engineering and technology might know him better for the part he played in the development of mobile computing; Wood's concerns are not with the past, but the future. But sometimes the future starts with a little history. Wood worked on the personal digital assistant (PDA) at Psion, which was Europe's leading manufacturer of handheld computers for several years, and coined the term 'organiser'. Realising the technology that went into making the PDA possible was also suited to a category of technology that could be 'dimly glimpsed', Wood moved on to Symbian, where his "role was in envisaging future smart technology. I was a software architect for many parts of the resulting software system, which became known as Symbian OS".},
