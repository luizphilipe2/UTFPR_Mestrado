This International Standard was prepared to collect and standardize terminology. Its purpose is to identify terms currently in use in the field and standard definitions for these terms. It is intended to serve as a useful reference for those in the Information Technology field, and to encourage the use of systems and software engineering standards prepared by ISO and liaison organizations IEEE Computer Society and Project Management Institute (PMI). This International Standard replaces IEEE Std 610.12-1990, IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology, which was contributed by the IEEE as a source document. The approach and lexical exactitude of IEEE Std 610.12-1990 served as a model for this International Standard.

Be it search engine, recommendation system, streaming service, interactive agent, or collaborative system, multimedia plays a critical role in ensuring full understanding of multimodal sensory signals, robust modeling of user-content interaction, natural and rich communication experience, and scalable system deployment. The goal is to utilize unique contributions from each modality, integrate complementary synergies, and achieve the best performance and novel functions beyond what's separately available in each individual medium. In this community, most contributors also maintain strong activities in other disciplines such as networking, computer vision, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. But the field of multimedia is unique in offering a rich and dynamic forum for researchers from ""traditional"" fields to collaborate and develop new solutions and knowledge that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines.The field enjoys a long history of vibrant research. For example, the flagship ACM SIGMM Multimedia Conference was established in 1993, celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. The community also has several well-known conferences and journals organized by ACM, IEEE, and other groups, attracting a large number of researchers and practitioners from around the world. However, despite the prolific research activities and outcomes, there has been less effort toward developing books that serve as an introduction to the rich spectrum of topics in this broad field. Most of the few books available today either focus on specific subfields or basic background. There is a lack of tutorial-style materials covering the active topics being pursued by the leading researchers at frontiers of the field.SIGMM launched a new initiative to address this need in 2015, by selecting and inviting 12 rising-star speakers from different subfields of multimedia to deliver plenary tutorial style talks at ACM Multimedia 2015. Each speaker discussed challenges and the state of the art within their prospective research areas in a general manner to the broad community. Topics covered were comprehensive, including multimedia content understanding, multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction, multimedia social media, and multimedia system architecture and deployment. Following the very positive responses to the talks, these rising-star speakers were invited to expand the content covered in their talks to chapters that can be used as reference materials for researchers, students, and practitioners. Each resulting chapter discusses problems, technical challenges, state-of-the-art approaches and performances, open issues, and promising directions for future work. Collectively, the chapters provide an excellent sampling of major topics addressed by the community as a whole. This book, capturing outcomes of such efforts, is well positioned to fill the aforementioned needs by providing tutorial-style reference materials for frontier topics of multimedia.Section 1 of the book includes five chapters that are focused on analysis and understanding of multimedia content. Topics covered range from analysis of video content, audio content, multimodal content about interaction of freestanding conversational groups, and analysis of multimedia data in the encrypted format for preserving privacy on cloud servers, to efficient approximate similarity search techniques for searching over large-scale databases.First, Zuxuan Wu et al. review current research on understanding video content by detecting the classes of actions or events contained in a given video clip and generation of full-sentence captions describing the content in each such video. Unlike previous surveys, this review focuses on solutions based on deep learning, reflecting the recent trend of research in this area. The chapter also gives extensive reviews of the datasets used in state-of-the-art research and benchmarking efforts.Extending the modality from video to audio, in Chapter 2, Gerald Friedland et al. introduce the field of computer audition, aiming to develop the theory behind artificial systems that can extract information from sound. This chapter reviews the research datasets available, appropriate representations needed for audio, and a few challenging problems such as automatic extraction of hierarchical semantic structures from audio content and automatic discovery of high-level semantic concepts from massive audio data and associated metadata.The holy grail of research for the multimedia community is to be able to integrate and fuse information extracted from multiple modalities of data. In Chapter 3, Xavier Alameda-Pineda et al. present an excellent example and emergent research challenges in the application of detecting social interaction among freestanding conversational groups. The chapter includes overviews of research issues, approaches, evaluation of joint estimation of head and body poses using multiPreface modality data (such as wearable sensors and distributed camera networks), and results of detecting dynamic group formation of interacting people.Chapter 4 addresses a novel emerging topic prompted by the popular approach to multimedia analysis using cloud computing servers. When multimedia data is sent to the cloud for storage or processing, there is a risk of privacy breach via unauthorized access by third parties to the content in the cloud. Pradeep Atrey et al. review state-of-the-art methods and open issues for processing multimedia content in the encrypted domain without needing to convert data to the original format. This allows content to stay in its protected form while useful analysis is performed on it.In Chapter 5, Herv\'{e}e Jeundefinedou surveys efficient techniques for finding approximate solutions for similarity search, which is of particular interest when searching massive multimedia data like images, videos, and audio recordings. Jeundefinedou considers various performance factors like query speed, memory requirement, and search accuracy. Multiple frameworks based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH), quantization/ compression, and hybrid combinations are also reviewed in a coherent manner.In Section 2 of the book, the emphasis shifts from content analysis to humancentered aspects of multimedia computing. This new focus goes beyond extraction of semantic information from multimedia data. Instead, the broad research scope incorporates understanding of users and user-content interaction so as to improve effectiveness of multimedia systems in many applications, such as search and recommendation.Under the human-centric theme, Chapter 6, authored by Peng Cui, discusses the evolution of multimedia computing paradigms from the data-centric, to the content-centric, and recently to the human-centric. Cui presents a new framework, called social-sensed multimedia computing, to capture many key issues involved and advances achieved, including understanding of user-content interaction behavior, understanding of user intent, multimedia representation considering user intention, and integration of heterogeneous data sensed on multimedia social networks.Chapter 7 follows the human-centric theme and further moves the focus from processing individual multimedia data streams to processing a large number of heterogeneous streams in different modalities involving a large number of people. Analysis of such massive streams offers the possibility of detecting important situations of society, such as socio-economic affairs, as well as the living environment. Vivek Singh provides an overview of the problem definition, research framework, and the EventShop toolkit he developed for application development in this emerging area.The extension to the human-centric computing paradigm also calls for formal mathematical theories and tools for explaining the phenomena observed, such as the information propagation behaviors and the occurrences of information cascades on social networks. In Chapter 8, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu et al. review stochastic processes such as the Hawkes point process for modeling discrete, interdependent events over continuous time. These are strongly related to patterns corresponding to retweet cascade events on social media. Successful models like these can help researchers understand information dissemination patterns and predict popularity on social media.Interaction between users and content reveals not only the intent of the user (covered in Chapter 6), but also attributes of the content as well as of the user him/herself. Such interaction can be manifested in multiple forms including explicit cues such as visual and verbal expressions, and implicit cues such as eye movement and physiological signals like brain activity and heart rate. Chapter 9 includes a survey by Subramanian Ramanathan et al. on how such implicit user interaction cues can be explored to improve analysis of content (scene understanding) and user (user emotion recognition).To support research and development of emerging multimedia topics discussed above, there is a critical need for new generations of communication and computing systems that take into account the unique requirements of multimedia, such as real-time, high bandwidth, distributiveness, major power consumption, and resource uncertainty. The popular cloud-based computing systems, though prevalent formanyapplications, are not suitable for large-scale multimedia applications such as cloud-based gaming service and animation rendering service.The last section of the book focuses on the systems aspect, covering distinct topics of multimedia fog computing (Chapter 10) and cloud gaming (Chapter 11). Cheng-Hsin Hsu et al. survey the emerging paradigm focused on fog computing, in which computing services are crowdsourced to the edge nodes or even to the client devices on the user end. This offers major potential benefits in terms of low latency, location awareness, scalability, and heterogeneity. However, it also poses many significant challenges in areas such as resource discovery, resource allocation and management, quality of service, and security. Discussion of these challenges, along with recent advances in this area, are presented in Chapter 10.Finally, as a concrete example of large-scale distributed multimedia computing systems, Chapter 11 (by Kuan-Ta Chen et al.) presents a comprehensive survey of cloud gaming, with emphasis on the development of platform and testbed, test scenarios, and evaluation of performance, in order to enhance optimal design of various components of the complex cloud gaming systems. In particular, the chapter overviews extensive research in areas such as open-source platforms, cloud deployment, client design, and communication between gaming servers and clients.The scope of this book is by no means exhaustive or complete. For example, it can be expanded to include other important topics such as (but not limited to) multimedia content generation, multimodal knowledge discovery and representation, multimedia immersive networked environments, and applications in areas like healthcare, learning, and infrastructure. Nonetheless, the comprehensive survey materials already covered in the book provide an excellent foundation for exploring additional topics mentioned above, and many other relevant fields.We would like to give sincere acknowledgment to Dr. Svebor Karaman, who has provided tremendous assistance in communicating with contributors and organizing the content of this book. In addition, Diane Cerra and her team at Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers have provided valuable guidance and editorial help",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Students of Software Engineering Capstone Courses face real world situations and challenges that grant them valuable experiences for their professional preparation. However, since this knowledge is acquired through real-life exposure projects, it is difficult to transmit it among different generations of students. In consequence, all the gained knowledge, experiences, and computer codes developed are lost and cannot be reused outside the project context when they finish their assignment at the end of the semester. To address this challenge, this thesis considers the development of AI based virtual assistants applied in higher education, in a form of a lesson learned system, a recommender system integrated with a chatbot, to help students , solve problems similar to those they face in the different stages of their software project development by recommending previous lessons learned. The innovative contribution lies in the implementation of the described techniques from the state-of-art artificial intelligence field in an educational platform with the goal to leverage the experience gained during years of the teaching a Capstone Course in Software Engineering to new student generations who might benefit from this universal knowledge gained previously, in order to assist software engineering students to enhance their learning experience.",,"Software Engineering teaching, lessons learned, collective knowledge, recommender systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they have not yet been widely adopted in embedded systems, particularly in resource-constrained devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). In this paper, we investigate the challenges involved in using face-based biometrics for authenticating a user to an embedded system. To enable high authentication accuracy, we consider robust face verifiers based on principal component analysis/linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) algorithms and Bayesian classifiers, and their combined use (multi-modal biometrics). Since embedded systems are severely constrained in their processing capabilities, algorithms that provide sufficient accuracy tend to be computationally expensive, leading to unacceptable authentication times. On the other hand, achieving acceptable performance often comes at the cost of degradation in the quality of results. Our work aims at developing embedded processing architectures that improve face verification speed with minimal hardware requirements and without any compromise in verification accuracy. We analyze the computational characteristics of face verifiers when running on an embedded processor, and systematically identify opportunities for accelerating their execution. We then present a range of targeted hardware and software enhancements that include the use of fixed-point arithmetic, various code optimizations, application-specific custom instructions and co-processors, and parallel processing capabilities in multi-processor systems-on-chip (SoCs). We evaluated the proposed architectures in the context of open-source face verification algorithms running on a commercial embedded processor (Xtensa from Tensilica). Our work shows that fast, in-system verification is possible even in the context of many resource-constrained embedded systems. We also demonstrate that high authentication accuracy can be achieved with minimum hardware overheads, while requiring no modifications to the core face verification algorithms",,Authentication;Embedded system;Biometrics;Hardware;Personal digital assistants;Embedded computing;Computer architecture;Open source software;Cellular phones;Robustness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the heart of every chatbot is a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component that enables the chatbot to understand natural language input. Recently, many NLU platforms were provided to serve as an off-the-shelf NLU component for chatbots, however, selecting the best NLU for Software Engineering chatbots remains an open challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate four of the most commonly used NLUs, namely IBM Watson, Google Dialogflow, Rasa, and Microsoft LUIS to shed light on which NLU should be used in Software Engineering based chatbots. Specifically, we examine the NLUs' performance in classifying intents, confidence scores stability, and extracting entities. To evaluate the NLUs, we use two datasets that reflect two common tasks performed by Software Engineering practitioners, 1) the task of chatting with the chatbot to ask questions about software repositories 2) the task of asking development questions on Q&A forums (e.g., Stack Overflow). According to our findings, IBM Watson is the best performing NLU when considering the three aspects (intents classification, confidence scores, and entity extraction). However, the results from each individual aspect show that, in intents classification, IBM Watson performs the best with an F1-measure>84%, but in confidence scores, Rasa comes on top with a median confidence score higher than 0.91. Our results also show that all NLUs, except for Dialogflow, generally provide trustable confidence scores. For entity extraction, Microsoft LUIS and IBM Watson outperform other NLUs in the two SE tasks. Our results provide guidance to software engineering practitioners when deciding which NLU to use in their chatbots.",,Chatbot;Task analysis;Software engineering;Software;Feature extraction;XML;Java;Software Chatbots;Natural Language Understanding Platforms;Empirical Software Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the fact that the methods and technologies of propaganda in its classic version are described in detail, in recent decades, the methods of propaganda influence have become more disguised and sophisticated: from the creation of bots in social networks to the fabrication of images and newspaper covers. In such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between true and false content, so the problem of selecting criteria for propaganda content is of particular importance today. The aim of the study is to identify the features of propaganda content in a digital society. The objectives of the research project include: the definition of “propaganda content” concept, the forms of its expression, the search for criteria to distinguish propaganda content from other types of information dissemination in social networks. The open materials of such programs as Hamilton 68, Digital Sherlocks, as well as the research of Computational Propaganda Worldwide conducted in Oxford were taken as an object. It is because of these and similar projects that the term “computer propaganda” is firmly entrenched in the scientific lexicon. The research methodology is based on the works of J. Bolsover, F. Howard, and a number of other foreign and domestic authors, indicating the following formats as components of promotional content in online communities: cyberattacks, bot farms, automatic distribution of posts on social networks, theft of data and disinformation. They are usually distributed simultaneously to maximize the coverage of the same information. The main methods of the study were case studies and content analysis. With their help, the case that caused social tension and long-term negative consequences (pension reform of 2018 in Russia) is considered. The analysis of the text format of information about this case, posted on social networks Facebook and Twitter, led to a number of conclusions: the methods used to identify propaganda content, require further serious study. The method of content analysis widely used for this purpose and the relatively recent method of intent analysis, due to the lack of the necessary methodology, are not always able to determine the availability of methods of propaganda influence. The results of the study allow us to state: computer propaganda in the modern world is very effective, including free or very inexpensive distribution. Moreover, the speed and the maximum number of users outreach by propaganda content become major issues. Today, social networks are a real arena of struggle, and the arsenal of propaganda means of influence is increasing exponentially. In these circumstances, the development of propaganda content identification methods can serve as a guarantor of success in the fight. This aspect is especially important in the long term, as in this way you can beat the competition and build the right communication strategy.",,Twitter;Tagging;Tools;Internet;Instruments;Pensions;political communication;propaganda;computer propaganda;pension reform;social networks;digital space,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we present a neural network that leverages Mozilla's open source implementation of Baidu's Deep Speech architecture; our model is currently able to solve the audio version of an open-source CATPCHA system (named SimpleCaptcha) with 98.8% accuracy. Our network was trained on 100,000 audio samples generated from SimpleCaptcha and can solve new SimpleCaptcha audio tests in 1.25 seconds on average (with a standard deviation of 0.065 seconds).

Distributed Denial of service attacks pose a serious threat to VOIP network security. SIP servers are victims of DDos attacks. The major aim of the DDos attacks is to avoid legitimate users to access resources of SIP servers. Distributed Denial of service attacks target the VOIP network by deploying bots at different locations by injecting malformed packets and even they halt the entire VOIP service causes degradation of QoS(Quality of Service). DDos attacks are easy to launch and quickly drain computational resources of VOIP network and nodes. Detecting DDos attacks is a challenging and extremely difficult due to its varying strategy and scope of attackers. Many DDos detection and prevention schemes are deployed in VOIP networks but they are not complete working in both realtime and offline modes. They are inefficient in detecting dynamic and low-rate DDos attacks and even fail when the attack is launched by simultaneously manipulating multiple SIP attributes. In this paper we propose a novel scheme based on Hellinger distance(HD) to detect low-rate and multi-attribute DDos attacks. Usually DDos detection and mitigations schemes are implemented in SIP proxy. But we leverage the SIP load balancer to fight against DDos by using existing load balancing features. We have implemented the proposed scheme by modifying leading open source kamailio SIP proxy server. We have evaluated our scheme by experimental test setup and found results are outperforming the existing DDos prevention schemes in terms of detection rate, system overhead and false-positive alarms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the advent of the Internet of Things, more and more devices are connecting to the Internet in order to help people get and share data or program actions. In this paper, we introduce an IoT Agent, a Web application for monitoring and controlling a smart home remotely. The IoT Agent integrates a chat bot that can understand text or voice commands using natural language processing (NLP). With the use of NLP, home devices are more user-friendly and controlling them is easier, since even when a command or question/command is different from the presets, the system understands the user’s wishes and responds accordingly. Our solution exploits several available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), namely: the Dialogflow API for the efficient integration of NLP to our IoT system, the Web Speech API for enriching user experience with voice recognition and synthesis features, MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for the lightweight control of actuators and Firebase for dynamic data storage. This is the most significant innovation it brings: the integration of several third-party APIs and open source technologies into one mash-up, highlighting how a new IoT application can be built today using a multi-tier architecture. We believe that such a tiered architecture can be very useful for the rapid development of smart home applications. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As software projects depend on multiple external dependencies, developers struggle to constantly track and check for corresponding security vulnerabilities that affect their project dependencies. To help mitigate this issue, Dependabot has been created, a bot that issues pull-requests to automatically update vulnerable dependencies. However, little is known about the degree to which developers adopt Dependabot to help them update vulnerable dependencies. In this paper, we investigate 2,904 JavaScript open-source GitHub projects that subscribed to Dependabot. Our results show that the vast majority (65.42%) of the created security-related pull-requests are accepted, often merged within a day. Through manual analysis, we identify 7 main reasons for Dependabot security pull-requests not being merged, mostly related to concurrent modifications of the affected dependencies rather than Dependabot failures. Interestingly, only 3.2% of the manually examined pull-requests suffered from build breakages. Finally, we model the time it takes to merge a Dependabot security pull-request using characteristics from projects, the fixed vulnerabilities and issued pull requests. Our model reveals 5 significant features to explain merge times, e.g., projects with relevant experience with Dependabot security pull-requests are most likely associated with rapid merges. Surprisingly, the severity of the dependency vulnerability and the potential risk of breaking changes are not strongly associated with the merge time. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate how developers receive Dependabot's security contributions. Our findings indicate that Dependabot provides an effective platform for increasing awareness of dependency vulnerabilities and helps developers mitigate vulnerability threats in JavaScript projects.",,Manuals;Security;Data mining;Open source software;Software development management;Dependabot;pull request;dependency;security vulnerability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several recent empirical studies show that developers, in practice, are applying refactoring incrementally when they are fixing bugs or adding new features. There is an urgent need for refactoring tools that can support continuous integration and some recent development processes such as DevOps that are based on rapid releases. Furthermore, several studies show that manual refactoring is expensive and existing automated refactoring tools are challenging to configure and integrate into the development pipelines with significant disruption cost.In this paper, we propose, for the first time, an intelligent software refactoring bot, called RefBot. Integrated into the version control system (e.g. GitHub), our bot continuously monitors the software repository, and it is triggered by any ""open"" or ""merge"" action on pull requests. The bot analyzes the files changed during that pull request to identify refactoring opportunities using a set of quality attributes then it will find the best sequence of refactorings to fix the quality issues if any.

The developer can review the recommendations and their impacts in a detailed report and select the code changes that he wants to keep or ignore.

Protecting the IoT infrastructure is not a straightforward task. There is an urgent need to handle different attack scenarios within the IoT smart environment. Attackers continuously targeted the modern aspects of technology, and trying abusing these technologies using complex attack scenarios such as Botnet attacks. Botnet attacks considered a serious challenge faces of the IoT smart environment. In this paper, we introduce a novel idea that capable of supporting the detecting of IoT-Botnet attack and in meanwhile to avoid the issues associated with the deficiencies of the knowledge-based representation and the binary decision. This paper aims to introduce a detection approach for the IoT-BotNet attack by using the Fuzzy Rule Interpolation (FRI). The FRI reasoning methods added a benefit to enhance the robustness of fuzzy systems and effectively reduce the system's complexity. These benefits help the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to generate more realistic and comprehensive alerts. The proposed approach was applied to an open-source BoT-IoT dataset from the Cyber Range Lab of the center of UNSW Canberra Cyber. The proposed approach was tested, evaluated and obtained a 95.4% detection rate. Moreover, it effectively smooth the boundary between normal and IoT-BotNet traffics because of its fuzzy-nature, as well as, it had the ability to generate the required IDS alert in case of the deficiencies of the knowledge-based representation. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

The chatbot was developed using a SQL database to store the question and answers using artificial intelligence mark-up language metadata. The user interface was built using PHP, adapted from Program-O. The open source PHP program was modified to support better display and the launching of URLs within the chatbot screen. Database content was created by “mining” library websites for information, and analyzing chat logs. The chatbot answers questions from a variety of users from around the world. It has attracted an unexpected number of social chatters, which required some additional metadata to accommodate personal chatting and to guide questions back to the intent of the project. The majority of questions are directional or factual questions that Pixel can handle. The database proved to be practical to build and revise as library resources and personnel changed. The chatbot provides a 24 hour, seven day a week service that is consistent, can be enhanced as resources, services, or staff change, and provides a playful interface that engages users. It replaces complicated navigation systems and scrolling through search results with more targeted answers, and has the ability to refer questions to librarians. Although chatbots have been around for several decades, there is a scarcity of reports in published library literature about their use in libraries. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Android likewise portrays an uprise in mobile devices and personal digital assistants. It is an open-source versatile platform fueling incalculable hardware units, tablets, televisions, auto amusement frameworks, digital boxes, and so forth. In a generally shorter life cycle, Android also has additionally experienced a mammoth development in application malware. In this context, a toweringly large measure of strategies has been proposed in theory for the examination and detection of these harmful applications for the Android platform. These strategies attempt to both statically reverse engineer the application and elicit meaningful information as features manually or dynamically endeavor to quantify the runtime behavior of the application to identify malevolence. The overgrowing nature of Android malware has enormously debilitated the support of protective measures, which leaves the platforms such as Android feeble for novel and mysterious malware. Machine learning is being utilized for malware diagnosis in mobile phones as a common practice and in Android distinctively. It is important to specify here that these systems, however, utilize and adapt the learning-based techniques, yet the overhead of hand-created features limits ease of use of such methods in reality by an end user. As a solution to this issue, we mean to make utilization of deep learning–based algorithms as the fundamental arrangement for malware examination on Android. Deep learning turns up as another way of research that has bid the scientific community in the fields of vision, speech, and natural language processing. Of late, models set up on deep convolution networks outmatched techniques utilizing handmade descriptive features at various undertakings.

In this paper, we show how it is possible to effectively group mobile botnets families by analyzing the HTTP traffic they generate. To do so, we create malware clusters by looking at specific statistical information that are related to the HTTP traffic. This approach also allows us to extract signatures with which it is possible to precisely detect new malware that belong to the clustered families. Contrarily to x86 malware, we show that using fine-grained HTTP structural features do not increase detection performances.

Surprisingly, no single database currently brings together all the various kinds of data from the vulnerability sites. Of particular interest to us was author and discoverer information since this provides valuable information about who is active in information security and occasionally might indicate the authors of exploits; current databases do not connect this to other relevant information. We found that the searchable parameters of the existing vulnerability databases were limited and inconsistent. Consequently, it is very difficult to get complete information about computer vulnerabilities by searching Web sites. Our approach was to bring together this information into a composite database. We did automated data collection from the existing Web vulnerability databases by creating Web bots that traversed Web sites and retrieved selected information from them, then imported the collected Web data into a relational database. A browser provides Web-based access to this database. [1] and [2] shows how such information can be used to build models of attacks in the form of graphs, trees, and finite-state machines, and thereby develop methods for system protection. We first wanted to use the Carnegie-Mellon US-CERT database (www.kb.cert.org/vuls) of 22,716 vulnerabilities from 1995. However, it is not downloadable online. So we took records from the Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) database (cve.mitre.org) with 15,000 entries, 11,000 entries from Secunia (www.secunia.com), 1,500 entries from US-CERT Vulnerability Notes Database (www.kb.cert.org/vuls) and 15,000 from SecurityFocus, more a newsgroup reporting vulnerabilities (www.securityfocus.com/bid). The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (nvd.nist.gov) contained mostly the same information as the CVE database in an XML format, and the Open Source Vulnerabilities Database (www.osvdb.org) appeared to duplicate most of the other information, so we did not use their data. Each database had its weaknesses. The US-CERT database could not be downloaded as a whole, only in small groups of records; the CVE database did not list discoverers or reporters of vulnerabilities; the Secunia and SecurityFocus databases did not contain data on all vulnerability alerts and candidates, and their vulnerability descriptions were often cryptic. Using ideas from [3], we created bots that collected information from the Web sources. These used crafted links to access forms pages and then processed the results in Java. Only the CVE database provided an easy means to download their database. The US-CERT Vulnerability Notes Database does not allow bots to search the database except by vulnerability number, and this appears randomly assigned from 1000 to 999999; so we manually grabbed the 54 pages of information containing vulnerability identifiers and iteratively searched for those with a bot. The Secunia database could be indexed by entry number ranging from 1 to 13000 with some omissions, so we just retrieved all 13000, getting blank pages for the omissions; however, some entries had no numbers and could not be found this way. Finally, we retrieved the SecurityFocus database pages in the same manner as Secunia, again getting some blank pages for nonexistent numbers. For each of these databases we analyzed the formats to develop ways to extract and organize the data on the page. We created a relational database using PostgreSQL, using character fields for each of the pieces of information extracted from the websites. Each site had a separate table for its data of 4000-15000 records. Text had to be cleaned up in a number of ways before entering it into this database, including conversion from HTML to strings, from strings to SQL char fields, from SQL char fields to strings, and from strings to HTML. There were also many small problems with non-English, Unicode, and punctuation characters, as well as the handling of a few large text entries. We created a Java servlet for free-text keyword search on the database. It can search on vulnerability name, author, CVE number, or affected system. These keyword searches are then coded into SQL and passed to the database. Selections, projections, and joins are made on our tables as necessary to produce the results. Currently, results are returned as tables, one for each of the selected source sites (Figure 1). Posing questions, like what percentage of vulnerability notices have a CVE number associated with them, involved some challenges in structuring the proper queries in SQL. These were fairly large tables and performing queries with join operations, such as finding data unique to one table, were prohibitively slow on a laptop computer. The CVE vulnerability numbers were quite helpful, since a vulnerability was often described quite differently by each organization. In seeking author or credit information, we found many entries of the Secunia site to state ""no credit."" Redesigning the Secunia bot to recursively search referenced advisories from those that provided no credit information reduced the number of ""no credit"" items from 40% to 15%. Interestingly, while the total number of vulnerabilities has been increasing since 1999, Mitre (the keeper of the CVE database) has labeled fewer candidate vulnerabilities (Figure 2). Another discovery was that the security-company data collection was not capturing the volume of vulnerabilities reported by the USCERT (Figure 3). Also of note is that individuals and private firms are critical to discovering vulnerabilities, since in both the Secunia and the SecurityFocus databases over 70% of the vulnerabilities were not found by the manufacturer of the software or hardware. Though not complete, this project has achieved most of its goals in collecting, storing, and accessing the computer-vulnerability database information from the Web. Even now, our system can provide some interesting data not easily gleaned from the Web. Comparisons between the commercial and the government sites will also prove interesting. Further development of the project would yield some answers about the timeliness of vendors in issuing resolution to problems, trends in systems vulnerabilities in contrast to competitors, identifying trends in authoring and submission of vulnerabilities, and measure how well the CVE naming convention for vulnerabilities is being used and applied. © 2006 IEEE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To tackle this problem, some visual tools such as Unity or Unreal have appeared. These tools are effective and easy to use, but they are not entirely aimed at end-users with little knowledge of software engineering. Currently, there is a resurgence in the use of chatbots thanks to the recent advances in fields such as artificial intelligence or language processing. However, there is no evidence about the use of conversational agents for developing video games with domain-specific languages (DSLs). This work states the following two hypotheses: (i) Conversational agents based on natural language can be used to work with DSL for the creation of video games; (ii) these conversational agents can be automatically created by extracting the concepts, properties and relationships from their abstract syntax. To demonstrate the hypotheses, we propose and detail the implementation of a framework to work with DSLs through a chatbot, its implementation details and a systematic method to automate its construction. This approach could be also suitable for other disciplines, in addition to video games development. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only bottleneck towards such implementation has been the dearth of open source conversational software platforms.

In this chapter we focus on the case of Wikipedia, where general public participation has recently grown very quickly, in part due to egalitarian principles that encourage free participation by everyone. However, widespread participation, coupled with the principle of neutrality of viewpoint," has led to ""editing wars"" (repeated text deletions and ""reverts"""," now largely controlled by ""(ro)bots""). The nature of participation has tended to change over time", with a migration of conflicts to discussion pages," especially in the case of articles on contentious issues (e.g. ""The Turin Shroud""). Our aim is to describe the characteristics of such OEC debates", in relation to their contexts and potential for effective knowledge elaboration. We describe an approach to studying argumentation practices in OECs based on articulating third-person (researcher) analyses, based on a pragma-dialectic model extended to include dimensions of knowledge elaboration and interpersonal relations, with a first-person (participant) perspective, where key contributors to controversial articles produced narratives on their 'life cycles'. On the basis of two case-study discussions we show that although debates are mostly epistemic, concerning article content and structure, the possibilities of anonymity and completely open participation also lead to disputes on an interpersonal (ad hominem) level," concerning expertise.

As an alternative to MPEG-4, one can also specify morph targets for different categories such as visemes, emotions and expressions, in order to achieve facial animation using the keyframe interpolation technique. Morph targets from different categories are blended to create more lifelike behaviour. Results can be previewed and parameters can be tweaked real time within the application for fine tuning. Changes made take into effect immediately, which in turn ensures rapid production.

Specifically, we will discuss how the introduction of a bot for automated ticket assignment has helped in reducing the disparity in ticket assignment to engineers by human managers and also decreased the average ticket resolution time- thereby improving the experience for both the reporters and the engineers. Additionally, the bot sends reminders and status updates over different business communication platforms for timely tracking of tickets; it can be suitably modified to provision for human intervention in case of special needs by some teams.

The program covers 12 production areas including pesticide applications, fertilizers, herbicides, irrigation, tree removal/reset, mowing, hedging and topping, cold protection, drainage maintenance, equipment maintenance, and young tree care. Production managers can schedule future operations (budget), determine weekly and daily operations (recommendations/ worksheets) and record actual operations for historic analysis. The phenology model predicts bloom dates and other events around which production operations can be scheduled for optimal timing. The planning and scheduling program acts as a framework for additional decision support systems including fungicide spray residue estimation, irrigation scheduling, fertilizer best management practices (BMPs), and rootstock/cultivar selection. A grove observation program that runs on a hand-held computer (personal digital assistant or PDA) also integrates with the planning and scheduling module to facilitate record keeping of pest outbreaks.

However, since access to developers is non-trivial and research tool adoption is slow, new analyses are typically evaluated as follows: a prototype tool that embeds the analysis is implemented, a set of projects is identified, their revisions are selected, and the tool is run in a controlled environment, rarely involving the developers of the software. As a result, research artifacts are brittle and it is unclear if an analysis tool would actually be adopted.In this paper, we envision harnessing the rich interfaces provided by popular social coding platforms for automated deployment and evaluation of SE research analysis. We propose that SE analyses can be deployed as analysis bots. We focus on two specific benefits of such an approach: (1) analysis bots can help evaluate analysis techniques in a less controlled, and more realistic context, and (2) analysis bots provide an interface for developers to ""subscribe"" to new research techniques without needing to trust the implementation, the developer of the new tool, or to install the analysis tool locally.

BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that a personal digital assistant (PDA) based system reduces data collection delays and errors for tuberculosis (TB) laboratory results when compared to a paper system. OBJECTIVE: To assess the data collection efficiency of each system and the resources required to develop, implement and transfer the PDA-based system to a resource-poor setting. DESIGN: Time-motion study of data collectors using the PDA-based and paper systems. Cost analysis of developing, implementing and transferring the PDA-based system to a local organization and their redeployment of the system. RESULTS: Work hours spent collecting and processing results decreased by 60% (P < 0.001). Users perceived this decrease to be 70% and had no technical problems they failed to fix. The total cost and time to develop and implement the intervention was US$26 092 and 22 weeks. The cost to extend the system to cover nine more districts was $1125 and to implement collecting patient weights was $4107. CONCLUSION: A PDA-based system drastically reduced the effort required to collect TB laboratory results from remote locations.

It brings a plus of innovation by allowing students or hobbyists from every part of the world to consult and use the set of lab projects, which will be posted on the Digilent website. Even though there are other ways to study A VR microcontrollers, this one is more practical and easier to use. One of the reasons is the usage of affordable and available hardware, from Digilent, and free software from Atmel and Digilent websites. Each lab project is created with the purpose of bringing new information based on what has already been learnt in the previous ones and offers the possibility of exercising with specific tasks and complete answers. The answers are not available on the website; they will be given at the teachers' request. The projects are simple enough to be used with didactic purposes and complex enough to allow the integration in larger applications or to create reference projects for the modules used.

In fact, we assume that the “electronic design” is near to perfect, and that the FR is based only on the physical materials. However, based on field failures analysis, we have found that many failures actually occur due in large part to a poor design, and that this poor design is mostly caused by common mistakes. In this article, a new method will be introduced, which will provide guidelines to understanding the root cause of common design mistakes and eliminating them. These common design mistakes will then be transformed into a set of rules that we call a ""rule check,"" which will ensure that these very same mistakes will be detected and eliminated in new designs. Thousands of electronic board failures were collected for the duration of one year. The data was analyzed statistically, and for the 100 most important failures a root cause analysis was performed. It was found that 50 out of the 100 mistakes occurred due to errors in the design and these errors were based on common mistakes. To avoid these mistakes from reoccurring, a dictionary of rules was created which we call ""Good Design Reliability Practice"" (GDRP). The statistics show that the field failures are categorized as: - 25% are overstressed components and need to be up rated, - 35% are mistakes which increase the power dissipation and if we correct the mistake the power will be reduced, - 10% are mistakes which looks as if they are software failures but actually are hardware failures. - 30% are pure GDRP mistakes, such as pull-up /pull-down resistors, technology match, resistance/ capacitance values, power supply match etc. As of today we have successfully collected over 200 design rules, which have been grouped into five categories. These rules are used in the scanning of new designs, and significantly help eliminate the mistakes from reoccurring. Doing so dramatically increases the product's reliability (power dissipation and stress will be reduced) and robustness (design will be free from design errors). The innovation of the method is that by analyzing field failure data analysis we can setup rules which are checked in new designs.",,Reliability engineering;Stress;Biographies;Availability;Europe;Reliability;Stress;De-Rating;No Failure Found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,,Bot2015,"Bot, Yizhak; Azoulay, David",Asset maintenance simulation: The case-study of an offshore wind farm,,,,Jan,1-6,2015,,,,2015 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS),,,,,,,,,,,,"Offshore Wind Farms are very expensive assets, not only to design and build, but also to operate and maintain. Their remote location, coupled with weather's constraints and harsh marine environment, and the lack of adapted access equipment, make their maintenance complicated and expensive due to high repair costs, high transportations costs and painful production losses due to high downtime. More generally, the offshore wind technology is in a stage of development where its economic worthiness has still to be fully demonstrated, and numerous projects are largely supported by governmental subsidies. This lack of maturity is evident, for example, through the numerous reliability problems of wind turbines components. Both the inherent aspects of the offshore wind industry and the reliability problems it is facing contribute to the high Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs and eventually hinder its competitiveness compared to other sources of energy. It is commonly assumed that up to 25 % of the cost of energy produced by offshore wind turbines is due to O&M activities, which is twice as expensive as onshore installations. This paper describes a methodology to optimize the maintenance strategy of offshore wind farms in order to minimize life cycle costs and maximize availability and performance. The ApmOptimizer, developed by BQR Reliability Engineering is the software tool used for modelling, reliability analysis, cost and performance estimations and maintenance optimization. For the purpose of the demonstration, a case study of a typical wind farm is defined. A detailed model is built that accounts for numerous operational, cost and maintenance parameters. The ApmOptimizer optimization modules are then implemented for optimizing the preventive maintenance, periodical inspections, condition-based maintenance, and spares levels. Starting from a baseline scenario, several optimization steps are investigated, following a typical RAM/LCC analysis assessment procedure: Operational Availability, Operational Downtime, Lifecycle O&M Costs and produced Energy are used as the main metrics. The optimal maintenance strategy is obtained from an exact optimization process and not from Monte Carlo simulations that can provide only an approximate assessment for a user-inputted strategy. The study shows that by following several optimization steps, the wind farm performances can be significantly increased, to a level that makes the cost of produced energy more competitive. The influence of modelling parameters like failure distribution and degradation process is also investigated.",,Maintenance engineering;Optimization;Inspection;Wind farms;Reliability;Schedules;Wind turbines;Reliability;availability;wind farm;spare parts;preventive maintenance;predictive maintenance;life cycle cost and maintenance optimization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have evolved over the years from a means to pass the Turing Test to chatbots that fulfill a utilitarian purpose. Closed-domain chatbots are specialized in a specific knowledge base and are often used in an attempt to assist users in an educational context. Existing open-source, educational assistant chatbots are narrow in immediate functionality, thus limiting the content and services that can be provided to students and educators. To address this limitation, a novel multiagent framework is proposed, providing diverse capabilities and component flexibility to better meet varied educational requirements. The version presented in this experiment can not only answer questions in different styles but is also able to provide content summaries and links. The solution is tested by presenting participants with a lesson containing information related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), followed by engagement with the chatbot system, a subsequent evaluation of its responses, and a quiz to quantify its pedagogical efficacy. COVID-19 was chosen as the knowledge base due to its current relevance in society. The chatbot framework's knowledge base is comprised of two data sets containing facts related to the virus, one which is used to provide longer, frequently asked questions-type responses, and another used to provide short answers. The resulting participant evaluations indicate a preference for more informative responses in the experimental context and showcase the benefit of the framework's malleability in not only fulfilling but discovering varying needs in educational assistance. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main factors that hinder progress in this area are lack of training data and difficulty of automatic evaluation. Thus, to reliably evaluate the quality of such models, one needs to resort to time-consuming and expensive human evaluation. We tackle these problems by organizing the Conversational Intelligence Challenge (ConvAI) — open competition of dialogue systems. Our goals are threefold: to work out a good design for human evaluation of open-domain dialogue, to grow open-source code base for conversational systems, and to harvest and publish new datasets. Over the course of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions, we developed a framework for evaluation of chatbots in messaging platforms and used it to evaluate over 30 dialogue systems in two conversational tasks — discussion of short text snippets from Wikipedia and personalized small talk. These large-scale evaluation experiments were performed by recruiting volunteers as well as paid workers. As a result, we succeeded in collecting a dataset of around 5,000 long meaningful human-to-bot dialogues and got many insights into the organization of human evaluation. This dataset can be used to train an automatic evaluation model or to improve the quality of dialogue systems. Our analysis of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions shows that the future work in this area should be centered around the more active participation of volunteers in the assessment of dialogue systems. To achieve that, we plan to make the evaluation setup more engaging. Copyright © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The middleware provides software engineers with primitives to describe how context changes should be handled using policies. These policies may conflict. We classify the different types of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing and argue that conflicts cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed, but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate a method by which policy conflicts can be handled; this method uses a microeconomic approach that relies on a particular type of sealed-bid auction. We describe how this method is implemented in the CARISMA middleware architecture and sketch a distributed context-aware application for mobile devices to illustrate how the method works in practice.

On large code bases, static analysis tools produce thousands of warnings. It is unrealistic to expect users to review such a massive list and to manually make changes for each warning. To address this issue we propose CCBot (short for <bold>C</bold>ode<bold>C</bold>ontracts <bold>Bot</bold>), a new tool that applies the results of static analysis to existing code through automatic code transformation. Specifically, CCBot instruments the code with method preconditions, postconditions, and object invariants which detect faults at runtime or statically using a static contract checker. The only configuration the programmer needs to perform is to give CCBot the file paths to code she wants instrumented. This allows the programmer to adopt contract-based static analysis with little effort. CCBot's instrumented version of the code is guaranteed to compile if the original code did. This guarantee means the programmer can deploy or test the instrumented code immediately without additional manual effort. The inserted contracts can detect common errors such as null pointer dereferences and out-of-bounds array accesses. CCBot is a robust large-scale tool with an open-source C# implementation. We have tested it on real world projects with tens of thousands of lines of code. We discuss several projects as case studies, highlighting undiscovered bugs found by CCBot, including 22 new contracts that were accepted by the project authors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The threats from bots is growing rapidly and also increasing in technical sophistication causing various types of attacks. These attacks are affecting social aspects of human beings. Human being or legitimate users are cheated by false requests disturbing their social life. This paper aims to provide secured authentification by verifying strength of CAPTCHA. The strength of CAPTCHA can be verified by solving it. The CAPTCHA solving has mainly three steps such as preprocessing, segmentation and character recognition. The input distorted image of CAPTCHA is passed through preprocessing module which removes noise and gives raw image which is then segmented. These segmented characters are recognized using pattern-matching technique achieving 88% accuracy.

The ever-changing criminal conduct continuously challenges how well the present digital forensics could react. Data acquisition is an important part in mobile phone forensics. As the mobile forensic software becomes more mature and popular, most of them are now facing the same problem where the internal collecting tools must be installed in the mobile phones first so the data collecting could be started in turn. Whether this process is against the concept of protecting the original crime scene in forensics is questionable. A new concept called Live SD is therefore introduced in this work.

We propose the design and implementation of such software. We also aim to assess the feasibility of using VR as a modality for navigating 3D visualizations of medical scenes. METHODS: To achieve our goal, we added VR capabilities to the open-source medical image analysis and visualization platform, 3D Slicer. We designed the VR extension by basing the software architecture on VTK's vtkRenderingOpenVR software module. We extended this module by adding features such as full interactivity between 3D Slicer and the VR extension during VR use, variable volume rendering quality based on user headset motion etc. Furthermore, the VR extension was tested in a feasibility study in which participants were asked to complete specific tasks using bot the conventional mouse-monitor and VR method. For this experiment, we used 3D Slicer to create two virtual settings, each having an associated task. Participants were asked to maneuver the virtual settings using two approaches, the conventional method, using mouse and monitor, and VR using the head-mounted-display and controllers. The main outcome measure was total time to complete the task. RESULTS: We developed a VR extension to 3D Slicer-SlicerVirtualReality (SlicerVR). Additionally, from the experiment we conducted we found that when comparing mean completion times, participants, when using VR, were able to complete the first task 3 minutes and 28 seconds quicker than the mouse and monitor method (4 minutes and 24 seconds vs. 7 minutes and 52 seconds, respectively); and the second task 1 minute and 20 seconds quicker (2 minutes and 37 seconds, vs. 3 minutes and 57 seconds, respectively). CONCLUSION: We augmented the 3D Slicer platform with virtual reality capabilities. Experiments results show a considerable improvement in time required to navigate and complete tasks within complex virtual scenes compared to the traditional mouse and monitor method. © 2019 SPIE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GiGi-MR has several distinctive features: it allows non-expert users to easily partition their jobs in several parallel tasks; such Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) are executed in parallel as a set of MapReduce applications; the volunteer resources that provide the best match for the tasks being executed are chosen (using attenuated bloom filters); it provides a portable checkpointing fault-tolerance mechanism based on virtualization; it does not rely exclusively on a central server (or servers) at all times (thus minimizing the bottleneck effect); it deals with malicious participants (possibly byzantine) using an efficient partial replication mechanism to validate the results obtained; and it is compatible with BOINC (one of the most popular open-source software platforms for computing using volunteered resources). We describe GiGi-MR's architecture and evaluate its performance by executing several MapReduce applications on a wide area testbed. Furthermore, we use micro-benchmarks to assess each one of GiGi-MR's components independently. The system's overhead is minimal.

Balinese culture is a legacy of the world's riches that must be preserved. In the development of the education world and technology today, there have been many efforts done to preserve Balinese culture such as researches used to document Balinese cultures. One study for the preservation of Balinese culture in the field of technology is the Balinese script transliteration application. Balinese script is one of the traditional Indonesian archipelago that created in Bali. Because its use is limited to a narrow scope in everyday use, most Balinese script has been replaced with Latin letters. Therefore this research is focused on preserving Balinese script using robot technology. The robot that developed in this research is a robot that can write Balinese script using a design resembles a human arm. Its connected to the computer using USB and mDraw a graphics program developed based on open source python. mDraw will give input to the robot in .svg format that generated by the Pasang Aksara transliteration application. This .svg or vector as input mDraw will give command to the robot to write the transliteration result on a piece of paper. In this paper a new idea has been proposed to implement the robot on cultural preservation and Balinese script education. This robotic arm was successfully tested and the result are 60% (21 glyph) categorized as very good, 37.14% (13 glyph) categorized as good, and 2.86% (1 glyph) enough. And for the Pasang Aksara transliteration application obtained the result of accuracy 75,73 % (of 861 words) for the correct test count and 24,7 % (of 276 words) for wrong test, count from 1137 word on thirteen kinds of special word in transliteration rules. For future development, replacement servo motors are located on the pen to make the process on the ups and downs of the pen smoother for more accurate Balinese script writing by the robot. The FSA method used is still constrained by some special words that failed to be transliterated correctly, so it is necessary to develop a certain algorithm so the accuracy of transliteration can reach 100%.",,Writing;Automata;Manipulators;Testing;Education;Cultural differences;Robot;Balinese script;Finite State Automata;Education;Cultural Preservation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Usability requirements can be considered to be requirements that capture the usability goals and associated measures for a system under development. In order to ensure usable systems we must ensure identification of appropriate requirements regarding these critical aspects of systems. There is a basic need for systematic approaches to reason, model and analyze usability from the early stages of the software development. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop a usable ontology or classification of measurable aspects of usability that can be used to aid in the specification of usability requirements. These ontologies should be represented in a way that facilitates their use as guidelines for the requirements elicitation process. We build on review of literature in the area of human-computer interaction and of usability engineering in developing a catalog of aspects of usability that can be considered during requirements gathering. This catalogue is used to guide the requirements engineer through alternatives for achieving usability. The approach is based on the use of the i* framework, having usability modeled as a special type of goal.",,Usability;Programming;Ontologies;Software safety;Personal digital assistants;Mathematics;Statistics;Guidelines;Software performance;Information retrieval,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assistance over the phone or in-person is often limited to office hours and the information online is scattered through numerous (often nested) web pages, often independently administered and maintained by each sub-division. In this work, we present CollegeBot, a conversational AI agent that uses natural language processing and machine learning to assist visitors of a university’s web site in easily locating information related to their queries. We discuss how we create the knowledge base by collecting and appropriately preprocessing information that is used to train the conversational agent for answering domain-specific questions. We have evaluated two different algorithms for training the conversational model for the chatbot, namely a semantic similarity model and a deep learning one leveraging Sequence-to-Sequence learning model. The proposed system is able to capture the user’s intent and switch context appropriately. It also leverages the open source AIML chatbot ALICE to answer any generic (non domain-specific) questions.

The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the educational process is one of the most important trends of modern eLearning since it can provide flexibility of learning and can performing adaptation of the learning process based on the personal needs of each user. AI technologies are positioned as the best solution for the analysis of each learner’s personal requirements and for generating a corresponding learning path with personalized educational content. One of the possible outcomes of introducing AI and ML into the eLearning process is the usage of AI-powered chatbots. Chatbots could significantly simplify the learning process by providing learners with the resources they are looking for which have previously been tailored for their learning personal characteristics. The integration of chatbots provides answers corresponding to the personal requirements of each learner into the eLearning system and could cover the gap in real-time consulting, which is not available with offline courses. Development of a chatbot is a trivial task for modern software engineering. However the determination of a chatbot behavior and its source dictionary is a complex task that requires development and implementation of additional analytic algorithms and models.

In Requirements Engineering, role-playing is a popular way to provide students hands-on experience with requirements elicitation interviews. [Problem] However, managing a role-playing activity to simulate requirements elicitation interviews in a class is time consuming, as it often requires pairing students with student assistants or fellow classmates who act as either customers or requirement analysts as well as creating and maintaining the interview schedules between the actors. To make the adoption of role-playing activities in a class feasible, there is a need to develop a solution to reduce instructors’ workload. [Principal ideas] To solve this problem we propose the use of VIrtual CustOmer (VICO), an intent-based, multimodal, conversational agent. VICO offers an interview experience comparable to talking to a human and provides a transcript of the interview annotated with the mistakes students made in it. The adoption of VICO will eliminate the need to schedule interviews as the students can interact with it in their free time. Moreover, the transcript of the interview allows students to evaluate their performance to refine and improve their interviewing skills. [Contribution] In this research preview, we show the architecture of VICO and how it can be developed using existing technologies, we provide an online rule-based initial prototype and show the practicality and applicability of this tool through an exploratory study. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We design the resulting grid/cloud to be resilient against network link or server failures. To this end, we exploit relocation: Under failure conditions, a grid job or cloud virtual machine may be served at an alternate destination (i.e., different from the one under failure-free conditions). We thus consider grid/cloud requests to have a known origin, but assume a degree of freedom as to where they end up being served, which is the case for grid applications of the bag-of-tasks (BoT) type or hosted virtual machines in the cloud case. We present a generic methodology based on integer linear programming (ILP) that: chooses a given number of sites in a given network topology where to install server infrastructure; and determines the amount of both network and server capacity to cater for both the failure-free scenario and failures of links or nodes. For the latter, we consider either failure-independent (FID) or failure-dependent (FD) recovery. Case studies on European-scale networks show that relocation allows considerable reduction of the total amount of network and server resources, especially in sparse topologies and for higher numbers of server sites. Adopting a failure-dependent backup routing strategy does lead to lower resource dimensions, but only when we adopt relocation (especially for a high number of server sites): Without exploiting relocation, potential savings of FD versus FID are not meaningful.",,Servers;Routing;Optical fiber networks;Data models;Bandwidth;WDM networks;Network topology;Anycast;cloud computing;column generation;dimensioning;grid computing;integer linear programming (ILP);linear programming;optical networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim: Find an automated way of identifying bots and code committed by these bots, and to characterize the types of bots based on their activity patterns. Method and Result: We propose BIMAN, a systematic approach to detect bots using author names, commit messages, files modified by the commit, and projects associated with the commits. For our test data, the value for AUC-ROC was 0.9. We also characterized these bots based on the time patterns of their code commits and the types of files modified, and found that they primarily work with documentation files and web pages, and these files are most prevalent in HTML and JavaScript ecosystems.

This differs from client/server architectures, in which some computers are dedicated to serving the others."" But peer-to-peer is much more than a technology; it represents a radical change in how we will soon use our computers. It is, all at once, a revolution, an evolution, and a revision. It is a revolution because it turns today's current client/server architecture on its ear. Suddenly, we're all producers of information as well as mere consumers. Peer-to-peer computing is also a cultural revolution. Peer-to-peer technology will fundamentally change the way small groups work and interact over the Internet. By making it easy to find and download music over the Web, Napster not only has shown how fragile intellectual property rights of digital material are, but has probably affected the business model of the major media players, too. It is an evolution because the current state of software engineering makes possible distributed processing and storage across personal computers, as well as the first attempts to provide an operating system for the Internet. It is a revision because, in the early days of the Internet, peer-to-peer is how all computers were interconnected. The rise of the Web, with millions of people surfing, engaging in e-commerce, and downloading streaming video, made client/server architecture a really good idea. About Groove Groove is an application that uses the Internet to make direct connections between members of a group. That group can consist offriends, family, co-workers, or any collection of people who want to communicate, solve problems, or work on a common task. Some of the functions of Groove let you talk, chat, send instant messages, draw pictures, share photos and files, play games, and browse the Web with other members of your group. With Groove, you communicate within secure, shared virtual spaces, in real-time, or in different places at different times. In addition, Groove is a platform that allows you to create, deploy, and run your own peer-to-peer applications. At the time of this writing, Groove runs only on PCs running the Windows operating system. These are the minimum requirements for installing and running Groove: A 233MHz Pentium processor or equivalent 64MB of RAM 40MB of available hard disk storage A 56kbps modem (DSL or cable modem preferred) Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or greater (IE 5.0 or greater recommended) A sound card, speakers, and microphone, for using the voice features Updated minimum requirements are posted at www.groove.net/downloads/groove. Who Should Read This Book This book is intended for those who want to develop peer-to-peer applications in Groove. The skills required to develop Groove applications include an understanding of the peer-to-peer paradigm, a working knowledge of extensible Markup Language (XML), familiarity with Open Software Description (OSD), and the ability to understand programming in JavaScript. Only the programming skill will be assumedthis book will help the reader develop the remaining skills. Information on these skills wi presented. The material is slanted toward intermediate programmers and advanced beginners but should be useful for advanced programmers with little prior knowledge of the peer-to-peer space. How the Book Is Structured The following 15 chapters give advanced beginner or intermediate programmers all the necessary background needed to understand the peer-to-peer paradigm, the Groove application, Groove architecture, XML, and OSD, as well as the ability to program and deploy an application on the Groove peer-to-peer platform: Chapter 1, ""Why Peer-to-Peer "" explores the historical roots of peer-to-peer applications and discusses why peer-to-peer will be even more important in the future. Peer-to-peer applications are contrasted with client/server applications, highlighting strengths and weaknesses for various tasks. Chapter 2, ""What Is Groove "" touches on the history of Groovewhy and how it was developed. It describes the product and presents a case study of its use to solve an actual business problem. The chapter concludes showing why Groove is particularly useful to intermediate programmers or advanced beginners wanting to program in the peer-to-peer space. Chapter 3, ""Exploring the Groove Application,"" exposes you to the Groove application. Detailed instructions for installing the application from the CD and a tour of Groove features let readers have the opportunity to experience peer-to-peer interaction. You will see and use some Groove tools similar to the ones you will soon be building. In Chapter 4, ""Understanding Groove Architecture,"" you learn the concept of a shared space and the function of the Groov services that take care of security, persistence, and dissemination of data are explored so that you'll understand what services Groove provides. Component services are particularly covered so that you'll know how versioning and automatic dissemination of Groove toolsincluding tools you may buildtakes place. Chapter 5, ""Essential XML,"" presents the basics of XML as they relate to Groove operation and tool development. Chapter 6, ""Essential OSD,"" explores the concept of Open Software Description. OSD provides an XML-based vocabulary for describing software packages and their interdependencies. With OSD, Groove provides the means for extending and updating the Groove application, including tools like the ones you will develop. Writing OSD is an essential step of tool development in Groove. Chapter 7, ""Creating a Groove Development Environment,"" assists you in configuring your machines to easily develop Groove tools without affecting their capability to use Groove. You will verify that you have the applications you need to program Groove tools. All necessary applications are either included in system software or freely downloadable from the Net. Next, you'll learn how to reconfigure Groove to be able to safely build tools. Finally, we will walk you through the installation of the Groove Development Kit (GDK) and explore its contents. Chapter 8, ""Customizing Groove,"" gives you the opportunity to create your own Groove skin. Creating a skin provides an easy entry into many of the concepts needed to develop Groove tools. In Chapter 9, ""Building a Basic Groove Tool,"" a short discussion of the steps and elements neede is followed by a step-by-step tutorial. The tutorial begins the creation of a peer-to-peer trivia game tool, and addresses User Interface (UI), persistence, and dissemination issues. This part requires hand-coding of the XML for both understanding and experience. After an exploration of the tool descriptor, OSD, and .GRV files, Chapter 10, ""Publishing a Basic Groove Tool,"" is a step-by-step tutorial on publishing the tool created in the preceding chapter. Chapter 11, ""Easier Groove: The Tool Creator and Tool Publisher,"" introduces two tools supplied by Groove to make creating and publishing tools easier. You use these tools to finish the trivia game application. Chapter 12, ""Easier Groove: Modifying the Basic Groove Tool with Tool Creator and Tool Publisher,"" is a tutorial that uses Tool Creator and Tool Publisher to modify and extend the trivia game tool and to republish it. Chapter 13, ""Data Integration and Groove Bots,"" is a study of data integration in Groove through connectors and Groove bots. Data integration extends the reach of Groove tools by allowing them to connect with external information and applications resources. The chapter also covers some of the features and capabilities of bots and the Groove Enterprise Integration Server. Chapter 14, ""Advanced Topics,"" continues the ongoing discussion of OSD, particularly redirection and directory structure strategies, and introduces some of the advanced features found in Groove. We explore Groove versioning and its implications for writing tools, and then talk about how to add roles and permissions to your tools, and how to provide overview and context help. We fin and how they can be used. In Chapter 15, ""The Future of Peer-to-Peer,"" we make some guesses about how peer-to-peer applications will develop in the years to come, and examine the opportunities that will arise for peer-to-peer application programmers. If you're ready, let's get started!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current research in this area is held back by a lack of consensus of what software engineering bots (DevBots) actually are, what characteristics distinguish them from other tools, and what benefits and challenges are associated with DevBot usage. In this paper we report on a mixed-method empirical study of DevBot usage in industrial practice. We report on findings from interviewing 21 and surveying a total of 111 developers. We identify three different personas among DevBot users (focusing on autonomy, chat interfaces, and “smartness”), each with different definitions of what a DevBot is, why developers use them, and what they struggle with.We conclude that future DevBot research should situate their work within our framework, to clearly identify what type of bot the work targets, and what advantages practitioners can expect. Further, we find that there currently is a lack of general purpose “smart” bots that go beyond simple automation tools or chat interfaces. This is problematic, as we have seen that such bots, if available, can have a transformative effect on the projects that use them.",,"Empirical study, Software engineering, Software bot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perfect language classes are the basis for the automata-theoretic approach to model checking: a system is correct if the language generated by the system is disjoint from the language of bad traces. Regular languages are perfect, but because the disjointness problem for context-free languages is undecidable, no class containing them can be perfect. In practice, verification problems for language classes that are not perfect are often under-approximated by checking if the property holds for all behaviors of the system belonging to a fixed subset. A general way to specify a subset of behaviors is by using bounded languages. A class of languages C is perfect modulo bounded languages if it is closed under Boolean operations relative to every bounded language, and if the emptiness problem is decidable relative to every bounded language. We consider finding perfect classes of languages modulo bounded languages. We show that the class of languages accepted by multi-head pushdown automata are perfect modulo bounded languages, and characterize the complexities of decision problems. We also show that bounded languages form a maximal class for which perfection is obtained. We show that computations of several known models of systems, such as recursive multi-threaded programs, recursive counter machines, and communicating finite-state machines can be encoded as multi-head pushdown automata, giving uniform and optimal underapproximation algorithms modulo bounded languages.",,Automata;Radiation detectors;Encoding;Magnetic heads;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Personal digital assistants;verification;underapproximation;formal languages;complexity;algorithms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apart from generating schedules that are robust and adaptive, the scheduler must be able to carry out rescheduling in real time in order to cope with the system uncertainty effectively. A real-time scheduling system is therefore needed to support not only the work of the production planner but also the operators on the shop floor by re-generating feasible schedules when required. This paper describes such a real-time scheduling system, which is in essence a SBO system integrated with the shop floor database system. The scheduling system, called OPTIMISE scheduling system (OSS), uses real-time data from the production line and sends back expert suggestions directly to the operators through Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). The user interface helps in generating new schedules and enables the users to easily monitor the production progress through visualization of production status and allows them to forecast and display target performance measures. Initial results from this industrial application have shown that such a novel scheduling system can help both in improving the line throughput efficiently and simultaneously supporting real-time decision making. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applications for this type of data are, among others, location based services, navigation systems and the planning of large-scale construction projects. For presentation purposes and especially when working in the field, powerful visualisation systems are needed that are also capable of running on mobile devices like notebooks, personal digital assistants (PDA) or even cell phones. In such application areas, the free movement of the viewer’s position and the interaction with the data are of great importance. Real-time visualisation of 3D geospatial data is already well established and also commercially successful in the entertainment industry, namely in the market of 3D video games. The development of software in this field is very cost-intensive, so that the packages are often used for several game products and are therefore universally applicable to a certain extend. These so-called game engines include not only visualisation functionality, but also offer physics, sound, network, artificial intelligence and graphical user interfaces to handle user in- and output. As certain portions or sometimes even the whole engine are released as open source software, these engines can be extended to build more serious applications at very little costs. The paper shows how these game engines can be used to create interactive 3D applications that present texture-mapped geospatial data. The integration of 3D data into such systems is discussed. Functionality like thematic queries can be implemented by extending the internal data structures and by modification of the game’s accompanying dynamic link libraries. © 2014 ISPRS.

Sophisticated Command and Control (C&C) infrastructures aim to prevent the detection and takedown of botnets and therefore pose a big challenge in the battle against network attacks of all kinds. In this paper, we present Chain Channels, a method for hidden botnet communication that exploits the digital signatures used in blockchains to inject subliminal messages. We show how subliminal messages can be included in signatures and distributed in blockchain transactions to the bots. We also show how the keying material required for extracting the subliminal information can be transmitted privately to the bots while being stored on a public blockchain. As proof of concept, we inject a subliminal message and a key in the Bitcoin blockchain and show how this information can be extracted from the transactions. Our method allows to establish a hidden C&C infrastructure over blockchains and send instructions to all bots without leaving any suspicious communication activities. The method relies only on digital signatures and is therefore applicable to numerous blockchains. The subliminal communication can not be distinguished from legitimate transactions, and mitigation would require redesigning blockchains to use new subliminal-free signature schemes. Our method provides a general hidden distribution channel over block chains and can be also applied to other scenarios where information needs to be transmitted covertly. It scales extremely well with the number of receivers (i.e., bots), and subliminal messages can even be distributed over different blockchains to exploit specific features of blockchains such as low transaction cost or fast confirmation times or to further obfuscate the existence of the C&C communication.",,Blockchain;Botnet;Bitcoin;Digital signatures;Data mining;Receivers;Broadband communication;blockchain;botnet;network security;subliminal channel;digital signatures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many research lines aimed at developing Artificial Intelligences, or “bots”, capable of challenging human players, use StarCraft as a platform. Several characteristics make this game particularly appealing for researchers, such as: asymmetric balanced factions, considerable complexity of the technology trees, large number of units with unique features, and potential for optimization both at the strategical and tactical level. In literature, various works exploit evolutionary computation to optimize particular aspects of the game, from squad formation to map exploration; but so far, no evolutionary approach has been applied to the development of a complete strategy from scratch. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of StarCraftGP, a framework able to evolve a complete strategy for StarCraft, from the building plan, to the composition of squads, up to the set of rules that define the bot's behavior during the game. The proposed approach generates strategies as C++ classes, that are then compiled and executed inside the OpprimoBot open-source framework. In a first set of runs, we demonstrate that StarCraftGP ultimately generates a competitive strategy for a Zerg bot, able to defeat several human-designed bots.",,Games;Artificial intelligence;Buildings;Optimization;Measurement;Sociology;Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a less familiar threat that many experts say could be just as dangerous: malicious bot software. A bot is a program that operates automatically as an agent for a user or another program. Hackers forward bots to victims by a number of means, and the software automatically infects vulnerable computers. The bots then wait for commands from a hacker, who can manipulate them and the infected systems without the user's knowledge. A hacker can install bots on multiple computers to set up botnets that they can use for massive distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm victimized systems' defenses. Botnets can also be used for mass spam mailings, installing key-logging software that can steal victims' passwords and data, and compromising computers to prepare them for infection by future viruses.",,Computer hacking;Peer to peer computing;Network servers;Electronic mail;Security;Web server;Internet;File servers;Open source software;Protocols,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many actors are partaking in development activities, such that a common understanding should be reached at numerous stages during the overall development life-cycle. For a few years now, Natural Language Processing techniques have been employed either to extract key information from free-form text or to generate models from the analysis of text in order to ease the sharing of knowledge across all parties. A significant part of these approaches focuses on retrieving lost domain and architectural knowledge through the analysis of documents, issue management systems or other forms of knowledge management systems. However, these post-processing methods are time-consuming by nature since they require to invest significant resources into the validation of the extracted knowledge. In this paper, inspired by collaborative tools, bots and Natural Language extraction approaches, we envision new ways to collaboratively record and document design decisions as they are discussed. These decisions will be documented as they are taken and, for some of them, static or behavioural models may be generated on-the-fly. Such an interactive process will ensure everyone agrees on critical design aspects of the software. We believe development teams will benefit from this approach because manual encoding of design knowledge will be reduced and will not be pushed to a later stage, when not forgotten.",,Tools;Natural language processing;Unified modeling language;Software;Monitoring;Software engineering;Collaboration;agile software development;documentation;model-driven development;natural language processing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part of the reason for this is that developers consider the design decision documentation process to be cumbersome. However documentation of design decisions proves to be a crucial aspect of software maintenance and enhance teams' shared understanding of a product. With the recent emergence of instant messaging in software teams (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams), our goal is to leverage their platform coupled to chat bots and natural language processing technologies to record design decisions as they arise. In doing so we place the system for recording design decisions into an environment that is already common place for software teams, dramatically reducing the barriers involved with recording design decisions as a separate task. We therefore propose a general framework composed of a chatbot, a natural language processing engine and exporting API to wikis to record and search design decisions enabling teams to focus on their day-to-day work with minimal disruptions in their workflow, but still keeping a project documentation up to date. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

They communicate with human actors through comments. While detecting their presence is important for many reasons, no large and representative ground-truth dataset is available, nor are classification models to detect and validate bots on the basis of such a dataset. This paper proposes a ground-truth dataset, based on a manual analysis with high interrater agreement, of pull request and issue comments in 5,000 distinct Github accounts of which 527 have been identified as bots. Using this dataset we propose an automated classification model to detect bots, taking as main features the number of empty and non-empty comments of each account, the number of comment patterns, and the inequality between comments within comment patterns. We obtained a very high weighted average precision, recall and F1-score of 0.98 on a test set containing 40% of the data. We integrated the classification model into an open source command-line tool to allow practitioners to detect which accounts in a given Github repository actually correspond to bots. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expected posttreatment swallow function is a critical consideration for preoperative counseling. The objective of this study was to identify predictors of swallow dysfunction following TOS for advanced tumor (T)-stage (T3-T4) OPC. Methods: A retrospective review from 1997 to 2016 at a single institution was performed. Eighty-two patients who underwent primary transoral resection of locally advanced OPCs with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included. The primary outcome measure was swallow function, as measured by the Functional Outcomes Swallowing Scale (FOSS) at 1 year postoperatively. Operative reports were reviewed, and the extent of resection and type of reconstruction were documented. Conjunctive consolidation was then performed to incorporate multiple variables and their impact on swallow function into a clinically meaningful classification system. Results: Fifty-six patients (68%) had acceptable swallowing at 1 year. T4 tumor stage and receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) were strongly associated with poor swallowing but did not reach statistical significance. Only base of tongue (BOT) resection ≥50% (odds ratio [OR] 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21–8.43) and older age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00–1.12) were significantly associated. Utilizing T-stage, adjuvant CRT, and BOT resection, a conjunctive consolidation was performed to develop a classification system for swallow dysfunction at 1 year. Conclusion: This study provides risk stratification for swallow function at 1 year following primary transoral resection of locally advanced OPCs. BOT resection ≥50%, especially when coupled with T4 tumor stage or adjuvant CRT, was associated with poor long-term swallow outcomes.

In addition, the redundant patterns of chatbot responses are classified into three categories for the first time. In order to verify the proposed method, a chatbot is implemented using Telegram, an open source messenger. By comparing the proposed method with an existent method for each pattern, it is confirmed that the proposed method significantly improves the redundancy avoidance rate.

A bot controls a number of units that may have to navigate in a partially unknown environment, while at the same time search for enemies and coordinate attacks to fight them down. Potential fields is a technique originating from the area of robotics where it is used in controlling the navigation of robots in dynamic environments. Although attempts have been made to transfer the technology to the gaming sector, assumed problems with efficiency and high costs for implementation have made the industry reluctant to adopt it. Our demo shows the use of Multi-agent Potential Fields (Mapf) in an open source Rts game. We will demonstrate both the potential fields as such, and the coordination of the agents.

One main challenge for online systems is to identify whether the users are humans or software robots (bots). While it is natural to provide service to human users, providing service for software robots (bots) comes with many security risks and challenges. Software robots are often used by spammers to create fake online accounts, affect search engine ranking, take part in on-line polls, send out spam or simply waste the resources of the server. In this paper we introduce a visual CAPTCHA technique that is based on generating random images by the computer, the user is then asked to match a feature point between two images (i.e. solve the correspondence problem as defined by the researchers in the computer vision area). The relationship between the two images is based on a randomly generated homography transformation function. The main advantage of our approach compared to other visual CAPTCHA techniques is that we eliminate the need for a database of images while retaining ease of use. © 2017 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After describing our vision on how to combine MDE and manually written code, we present the first technical contribution in this pursuit: a family of three metamodels to respectively model ROS nodes, communication interfaces, and systems composed from subsystems. Such metamodels can be used, through the accompanying Eclipse-based tooling made publicly available, to model ROS systems of arbitrary complexity and generate with correctness guarantees the software artifacts for their composition and deployment. Furthermore, they account for specifications on these aspects by the Object Management Group (OMG), in order to be amenable to hybrid systems coupling ROS and other frameworks.

Nonetheless, the initial efforts to use digital platforms have not yet been successful, partly due to the lack of support to the teachers, the lack of motivation strategies inside the platforms or the loss of the social interaction, which is key in a collaborative learning process. Collaborative learning integrates the interaction between the students and the teacher, or in the case of digital learning, with an educational software. However, it is difficult to provide such a frame of interaction between learners inside an educational software. Therefore, a chatbot is proposed with its own design and architecture which behaves like a “friend” or colleague in the education, here applied to bioprocesses. Along with the chatbot architecture, it is explained how it is integrated in the learning design through its database. This tailored database contains training example dialogs through questions raised by students from a course on Bioprocess Technology, while it also collects their common mistakes, etc. Moreover, this database contains a novel system of twin databases; one with correct information and another with small errors. Using this system, the chatbot provides a more accurate representation of a learner's peer and triggers critical thinking. Finally, the chatbot architecture is embedded inside a prototype open-source Educational Virtual Bioprocess Plant developed by the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering of the Technical University of Denmark, called FermProc. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this research study is to explore the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice social engineering-based techniques, attack methods, and platforms used for conducting such cybersecurity attacks and threats. We undertake a systematically directed Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) related to the recent upsurge in social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scheduling of BoT applications on Grids is an important issue for achieving high performance. Grid scheduling involves a number of challenging issues, mainly due to the dynamic nature of the Grid. To deal with this dynamic nature, in this paper, we propose an online scheduling algorithm called prudent algorithm with replication (PAR) for scheduling Grid applications. PAR is shown to prudently make scheduling decisions in such a way that it can tolerate inaccurate performance predictions. Another point to note is that PAR adopts task duplication as an attempt to reduce serious schedule increases. Moreover, since the applications to be performed may widely vary in terms of their required hardware and software, we also capture the loads' various processing requirements in our algorithms, a unique feature that is applicable for running proprietary applications only on certain eligible processing nodes. Thus, in our problem formulation each application can only be processed by certain processors as both the applications and processing nodes are heterogeneous. We then present a task selection policy, referred to as requirement-aware load selection (RALS) policy to handle the contention of multiple applications that have various processing requirements but share the same computing resources. Based on RALS and PAR, we develop two scheduling algorithms: requirement-aware prudent algorithm with replication (RAPAR), and requirement-aware knowledge-free algorithm with replication (RAKAR). RAPAR and RAKAR address the scheduling of multiple BoT applications with heterogeneous processing requirements on Grids. RAPAR works in scenarios where inaccurate performance prediction information is provided whereas RAKAR works without any prediction information. Performance evaluation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our approaches when compared to existing algorithms.",,Program processors;Processor scheduling;Prediction algorithms;Scheduling;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Schedules;Task scheduling;grid computing;bag-of-tasks applications;parallel computing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This results in a significant reduction in yield strength, and also causes some moderate increase in creep rate. For high Ag SAC alloys, adding Al 0.1-0.6% to SAC alloys is most effective in softening, and brings the yield strength down to the level of SAC105 and SAC1505, while the creep rate is still maintained at SAC305 level. Addition of Ni results in formation of large (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 IMC particles and loss of Cu3Sn4 particles. This also causes softening of SAC alloys, although to a less extent than that of Al addition. Addition of Al also drives the microstructure to shift from near-ternary SnAgCu eutectic toward combination of eutectic SnAg and eutectic SnCu. Addition of Ni drives shifting toward eutectic SnAg.

This has been achieved by using Media Wiki API to retrieve information from Wikipedia when the chatbot's local knowledge base does not contain the answer to user query. To make the conversation with chatbot more meaningful with regards to the user's previous chat sessions, a user specific session ability has been added to the chatbot architecture. An open source AIML web based chatbot has been modified and programmed for the use in health informatics domain. The chatbot has been named VDMS - Virtual Diabetes Management System. It is intended to be used by the general community and diabetic patients for diabetes education and management.",,Diabetes;Knowledge based systems;Internet;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Natural languages;Chatbot;Diabetes;Conversational Agent;VDMS;AIML,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A high demand for chatbots has drastically increased the global market size; however, the limited functional scalability of open-domain chatbots is a challenge to their application to industries. Moreover, as most chatbot frameworks employ English, it is necessary to create chatbots customized for other languages. To address this problem, this paper proposes KoRASA as a pipeline-optimization method, which uses a deep learning-based open-source chatbot framework to understand the Korean language. KoRASA is a closed-domain chatbot that is applicable across a wide range of industries in Korea. KoRASA's operation consists of four stages: tokenization, featurization, intent classification, and entity extraction. The accuracy and F1-score of KoRASA were measured based on datasets taken from common tasks carried out in most industrial fields. The algorithm for intent classification and entity extraction was optimized. The accuracy and F1-score were 98.2% and 98.4% for intent classification and 97.4% and 94.7% for entity extraction, respectively. Furthermore, these results are better than those achieved by existing models. Accordingly, KoRASA can be applied to various industries, including mobile services based on closed-domain chatbots using Korean, robotic process automation (RPA), edge computing, and Internet of Energy (IoE) services. © 2021 Myeong-Ha Hwang et al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Speech enabled virtual assistants (often named smart speakers) offer a wide variety of network-oriented services and, in some cases, can connect to smart environments, thus enhancing them with new and effective user interfaces. However, such devices also reveal new needs and some weaknesses. In particular, they represent faceless and blind assistants, unable to show a face, and therefore an emotion, and unable to `see' the user. As a consequence, the interaction is impaired and, in some cases, ineffective. Moreover, most of those devices heavily rely on cloud-based services, thus transmitting potentially sensitive data to remote servers. To overcome such issues, in this paper we combine some of the most advanced techniques in computer vision, deep learning, speech generation and recognition, and artificial intelligence, into a virtual assistant architecture for smart home automation systems. The proposed assistant is effective and resource-efficient, interactive and customizable, and the realized prototype runs on a low-cost, small-sized, Raspberry PI 3 device. For testing purposes, the system was integrated with an open source home automation environment and ran for several days, while people were encouraged to interact with it, and proved to be accurate, reliable and appealing.",,Personal digital assistants;Speech recognition;Face recognition;Face;Computer architecture;Google;Cloud computing;Smart home;virtual assistant;computer vision;deep learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach was tested during the second instalment of the Amazon Alexa Prize 2018 (AP2018), both for the data collection and to feed a simple dialog system which would use the graph to provide answers. As users interacted with the system, a graph which maintained the structure of the dialogs was built, identifying parts where more coverage was needed. In an ofine evaluation, we have compared the corpus collected during the competition with other potential corpora for training chatbots, including movie subtitles, online chat forums and conversational data.

In this paper, we show how macromanagement decisions in StarCraft can be learned directly from game replays using deep learning. Neural networks are trained on 789,571 state-action pairs extracted from 2,005 replays of highly skilled players, achieving top-1 and top-3 error rates of 54.6% and 22.9% in predicting the next build action. By integrating the trained network into UAlbertaBot, an open source StarCraft bot, the system can significantly outperform the game's built-in Terran bot, and play competitively against UAlbertaBot with a fixed rush strategy. To our knowledge, this is the first time macromanagement tasks are learned directly from replays in StarCraft. While the best hand-crafted strategies are still the state-of-the-art, the deep network approach is able to express a wide range of different strategies and thus improving the network's performance further with deep reinforcement learning is an immediately promising avenue for future research.

This problem is more serious with the application of lead free solder because lead free solder alloy have higher rigidity and lower ductibility compared with the traditional SnPb solder alloy. Whereas the drop test is high cost and long cycle, and the traditional board level drop simulation poses severe challenge to the computer resource, the theory analysis and modal superposition method are combined in this paper. Firstly, the drop vibration differential equation of simplified PCB assembly is deduced and the analytic solution is solved based on the given boundary condition according to the dynamics theory. Secondly, the ANSYS/LS-DYNA software is employed, a quarter 3D model with 15 representatives lead free TFBGA mounted on PCB is developed, and the dynamic responses of solder joint is analyzed under the drop impact. The critical solder joint with the maximal stress caused by deflection of PCB is identified by the model. Finally, the relationship between the number of screws which support the PCB and the PCB deflection under drop impact is studied through the modal superposition, and the influence of every stage mode to the PCB bending deflection is discussed. The results show that the outermost corner solder joint called critical solder joint is aptest to failure. More deflection of PCB causes larger stress of solder joint. The first bend mode is the main factor which influences the bending deflection of PCB. Adopting more screws to support PCB as well as reducing the influence of the first mode is good to improve the drop impact performance of solder joint. Compared with time history explicit dynamic analysis, modal superposition harmonic response analysis can save the solving time greatly.",,Modal analysis;Soldering;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Lead;Personal digital assistants;Stress;Fasteners;Harmonic analysis;Electronics packaging;Mobile handsets;Thin-profile fine-pitch ball grid array;Vibration equation;Dynamic response;Modal superposition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the use of electronic data capture (EDC) through mobile phones is limited in many areas by inconsistent network connectivity and poor access to electricity, which thwart data transmission and device usage. This is the case in rural Liberia, where many health workers live and work in areas without any access to cellular connectivity or reliable power. Many existing EDC mobile software tools are built for occasionally-disconnected settings, allowing a user to collect data while out of range of a cell tower and transmit data to a central server when he/she regains a network connection. However, few tools exist that can be used indefinitely in fully-disconnected settings, where a user will never have access to the internet or a cell network. This led us to create and implement an EDC software tool that allows for completely offline data transfer and application updating. Results: We designed, pilot-Tested, and scaled an open-source fork of Open Data Kit Collect (an Android application that can be used to create EDC systems) that allows for offline Bluetooth-based bidirectional data transfer, enabling a system in which permanently-offline users can collect data and receive application updates. We implemented this platform among a cohort of 317 community health workers and 28 supervisors in a remote area of rural Liberia with incomplete cellular connectivity and low access to power sources. Conclusions: Running a fully-offline EDC program that completely bypasses the cellular network was found to be feasible; the system is still running, over 4 years after the initial pilot program. The users of this program can theoretically collect data offline for months or years, assuming they receive hardware support when needed. Fully-offline EDC has applications in settings where cellular network coverage is poor, as well as in disaster relief settings in which portions of the communications infrastructure may be temporarily nonfunctional. © 2020 The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, GitHub introduced GitHub Actions, a feature providing automated work-flows for repository maintainers. Although several Actions have been built and used by practitioners, relatively little has been done to evaluate them. Understanding and anticipating the effects of adopting such kind of technology is important for planning and management. Our research is the first to investigate how developers use Actions and how several activity indicators change after their adoption.

Most commercial environments, during active hours, consume large amounts of energy resources; this could be optimized to the minimum by smartly monitoring and managing the resources. IoT (Internet of Things) enables this to be a possible solution at reasonable cost factors. However, it is important to note that in commercial environments, security is a key factor; corporations cannot depend on opening up their networks to the outside world in order to avail the services offered by currently available smart-devices. Localizing and privatizing the entire automation and control system would be desirable for such domains. The work presented in this paper proposes a solution for such applications which is crucial for the development of Smart Cities as a whole along with Smart Homes. One of the simplest tasks is to switch a light source, HVAC systems or any other electrical equipment on or off, by being physically present in the premises, remotely or automatically based on time or a sensor's reading. Furthermore, the intensity of the light source, the temperature of the HVAC systems and such parameters could also be varied. Development of technology in the field has enabled the production of cheap and small-sized computers like Raspberry Pi which are also known as Single Board Computers (SBC). The prototype designed is equipped with a secure local MQTT link for communication between the control and automation system and the Edge Devices. Additionally, it is equipped with a speech recognition system to give the users a much more intuitive and natural mean to communicate with and control the connected devices.",,Automation;Relays;Speech recognition;Cloud computing;Home automation;Computers;IoT;Control System;Digital Assistant;Home Automation;Smart Cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficient statistical evaluation of phenotyping data requires standardised data storage ensuring long-term data availability while maintaining intellectual property rights. This is state of the art at phenomics centres, which, however, are unavailable for most scientists. For them we developed a simple and cost-efficient system, the Phenotyper, which employs mobile devices or personal digital assistants (PDA) for on-site data entry and open-source software for data management. Results: A graphical user interface (GUI) on a PDA replaces paper-based form sheet and data entry on a desktop. The user can define his phenotyping schemes in a web tool without in-depth knowledge of the system and thus adjust it more easily to new research aspects than in a classical laboratory information management system (LIMS). In the Phenotyper, schemes are built from controlled vocabulary gained from published ontologies. Vocabulary and schemes are stored in a database that also manages the user access. From the web page, schemes are downloaded as extended markup language (XML) files for the transfer to the PDA and the exchange between users. On the PDA, the GUI displays the schemes and stores data in comma separated value format and XML format. After manual quality control, data are uploaded via a web page to an independently hosted results database, in which data are stored in an entity-attribute-value structure to provide maximum flexibility. Datasets are linked to the original and curated data files stored on a file server. The ownership stamp, project affiliation and date stamp of a dataset are used to regulate data access, which is restricted to data belonging to the user or to his projects and data, for which the embargo period has ended. By export of standardised ASCII reports to long-term data storage facility, long-term accessibility allows searching, citing and use of raw data beyond the lifetime of the database. The Phenotyper is available to the scientific community for use and further development. Conclusions: The Phenotyper provides a well-structured, but flexible data acquisition and management structure for mobile on-site measurements for efficient evaluation and shared use of data. © Köhl and Gremmels; licensee BioMed Central.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The need to recover data, which might refer to unlawful and unethical activities gave rise to the discipline of mobile forensics, which has become an integral part of digital forensics. Consequently, in the last few years there is an abundance of mobile forensics tools, both commercial and open-source ones, whose vendors and developers make various assertions about the capabilities and the performance of their tools. The complexity and the diversity of both mobile devices and mobile forensics tools, coupled with the volatile nature of the digital evidence and the legal requirements of admissibility makes it difficult for forensics investigators to select the right tool.

One of the features that uniquely characterize a botnet attack is that ""the infected machine (Bot) is being remotely controlled by an entity called ""Botmaster"". The Botmaster remotely controls these infected systems through ""Command and Control"" servers (C&C). Over a period of time complexity of botnets has increased many folds. Advance techniques employed by botnets such as protocol encryption, complex botnet structure and multi stage infection propagation models have made the botnets detection a challenging problem. Hence there is a need of a botnet detection mechanism which is independent of C&C protocol, structure and the infection propagation model used by the botnet. In the work presented in this paper, the experiments have been performed for evaluating the strength of existing botnet detection techniques, and proposed an advance detection mechanism which uses a logical combination of existing open source solutions with Honeynet technologies and our own mechanisms for botnets detection.

A typical A/B test involves dividing user traffic between two experimental conditions (A and B), and looking for statistically significant differences in performance indicators (e.g., conversion rates) between them. While this technique is popular, there are other, powerful data-driven methods --- complementary to A/B testing --- that can tie design choices to desired outcomes. Mining data from existing designs can expose designers to a greater space of divergent solutions than A/B testing [1,4] ,RICO:2017. Since companies cannot predict a priori if the engineering effort for creating alternatives will be commensurate with a performance increase, they often test small changes, along gradients to local optima. With the millions of websites and mobile apps available today, it is likely that almost any UX problem a designer encounters has already been considered and solved by someone. The challenges are finding relevant existing solutions, measuring their performance, and correlating these metrics with design features. Recent systems that capture and aggregate interaction data from third-party Android apps --- with zero code integration --- open-source analytics that were previously locked away in each app, allowing designers to test and compare UI/UX patterns found in the wild: [2,3] 2017.Lightweight prototypes with tight user feedback loops, or experimentation engines, can bootstrap product design involving technologies that are actively being developed (e.g., artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality), where both use cases and capabilities are not well-understood [5]. These systems afford staged automation: initially, ""Wizard of Oz'' techniques can scaffold needfinding, and eventually be replaced with automated solutions informed by the collected data. For example, a chatbot deployed on social media can serve as an experimentation engine for automating fashion advice [7]. At first, a pool of personal stylists can power the chatbot to collect organic conversations revealing common fashion problems, effective interaction patterns for addressing them, and design considerations for automation. Once technologies are developed to scale useful interventions [8,9], the chatbot platform provides a testbed for iteratively refining them. Generative models trained on a set of effective design examples can support predictive workflows that allow designers to rapidly prototype new, performant solutions [6]. Models such as generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders can produce designs based on high-level constraints, or complete them given partial specifications. For example, a mobile wireframing tool backed by such a model could suggest adding ""username"" and ""password"" input fields to a screen with a centrally placed ""login"" button.",,"data-driven design, fashion, ui/ux, design mining, mobile apps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, there is a great need for more intelligent and context sensitive DevOps tools and services that help developers increase their efficiency while developing and debugging.

This research investigates the various ways in which these communities manage this issue. It is shown that communities of open-source software--continue to--rely mainly on hierarchy (reserving write-access for higher echelons), which substitutes (the need for) trust. Encyclopedic communities, though, largely avoid this solution. In the particular case of Wikipedia, which is confronted with persistent vandalism, another arrangement has been pioneered instead. Trust (i.e. full write-access) is `backgrounded' by means of a permanent mobilization of Wikipedians to monitor incoming edits. Computational approaches have been developed for the purpose, yielding both sophisticated monitoring tools that are used by human patrollers, and bots that operate autonomously. Measures of reputation are also under investigation within Wikipedia; their incorporation in monitoring efforts, as an indicator of the trustworthiness of editors, is envisaged. These collective monitoring efforts are interpreted as focusing on avoiding possible damage being inflicted on Wikipedian spaces, thereby being allowed to keep the discretionary powers of editing intact for all users. Further, the essential differences between backgrounding and substituting trust are elaborated. Finally it is argued that the Wikipedian monitoring of new edits, especially by its heavy reliance on computational tools, raises a number of moral questions that need to be answered urgently.",,"Trust, Open-source software, Bots, Wikipedia, Reputation, Vandalism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of IoT devices are aimed at versatile smart devices, and these features need to be conveniently provided to users, such as for use in mobile. In addition, these devices must be able to tailor various functions and purposes to the needs of the user. Currently, open source platform provides flexibility in perspective of the developers in order to enable multi-purpose as a single device in terms of requirements for end users. However, this flexibility should be reconsidered from the end users, too. In this paper, we propose the cloud based multi-purpose IoT and provide convenience to the end user through the chatbot agent for end user friendliness. In addition, container technology is applied for versatility and flexibility of devices.

To enable these open-source AI bots to assist humans at different levels in learning Go, this paper proposes an intelligent agent for real-world applications in robotic edutainment and humanized co-learning. To achieve this, we successfully constructed an OpenGo Darkforest (OGD) cloud platform using these AI bots and further combined the brain computer interface with the OGD cloud platform to observe the relationship between the brainwaves and win rates of human Go players.

This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients'symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution. Objective: In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty, this study aimed to construct a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone. Methods: We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called ""Alpha"" to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. Results: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. Conclusions: With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

To take full advantage of this technology, organizations need to identify and to scope their routines. This is a challenging endeavor in large organizations, as routines are usually not concentrated in a handful of processes, but rather scattered across the process landscape. Accordingly, the identification of routines from User Interaction (UI) logs has received significant attention. Existing approaches to this problem assume that the UI log is segmented, meaning that it consists of traces of a task that is presupposed to contain one or more routines. However, a UI log usually takes the form of a single unsegmented sequence of events. This paper presents an approach to discover candidate routines from unsegmented UI logs in the presence of noise, i.e. events within or between routine instances that do not belong to any routine. The approach is implemented as an open-source tool and evaluated using synthetic and real-life UI logs.",,Task analysis;Data mining;Automation;Robots;Organizations;Pipelines;Payloads;Robotic process automation;robotic process mining;user interaction log,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we investigate the tradeoffs between video quality and the processor cycle requirements in such resource-constrained devices, in the particular context of MPEG-4 decoding using an open source codec called XviD. The XviD codec implements a number of powerful coding tools from MPEG-4, which are organized as profiles and levels. Given the specification of an architecture on which an XviD decoder is implemented, the work presented here would guide a multimedia applications developer in selecting appropriate profiles and levels for the corresponding encoder application. While the selection of such profiles has so far been primarily influenced by the network bandwidth in the case of video streaming, our work stresses the importance of additionally taking into account the architecture of the device running the decoder application. Although the relevance of this observation is increasingly being realized, sufficient work has not yet been done to provide guidelines on how to systematically make such selections.

So it is particularly important to forecast for hazardous chemical accidents and develop appropriate safety measures. In view of the analysis and summary of previous methods, an improved Hazardous Chemicals Accident Prediction method is proposed based on accident state vector in this paper. It defines the accident state vector using Multi-modal Data such as authoritative data, accident report, webpage, image, video, speech, etc. The Multi-modal Data is collected by web crawler which is built by open-source tools. The web crawler is an Internet bot which systematically browses the known hazardous chemical accident website, for the purpose of collecting Multi-modal accident data. As mentioned before, the Multi-modal Data is Multi format. In order to define the accident state vector easily, we divide the Multi- modal data into three dimensions based on the principle of accident causes. Respectively is the human factors, physical state factors, environmental factors. According to the geometrical distribution characteristics of support vector, it can be selected from the incremental samples that the sample of support vectors most likely to become forming a boundary vector set by adopting vector distance preextraction method, on which support vector training and accident prediction model build. It ensures the validity of predictive models due to various factors of the cause of the accident are fully considered by the accident state vector and advantages of support vector machines in high-dimensional, multi-factor, large sample datasets machine learning are exhibited. Sample experimental verification from the mastered accident of hazardous chemicals has showed that hazardous chemical accident prediction method proposed in this paper can effectively accumulate accident history information, possess higher learning speed and be positive significance for the safe development of hazardous chemicals industry. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.

In doing so, the research investigated the implications of such a sociotechnical system for the maintenance of the project and the emergence of collective intelligence. Using a theoretical framework informed by digital media studies, science and technology studies, and the political economy of communication, this study examined the material and ideological conditions in which Wikipedia has developed. The study's guiding research questions addressed the nature of Wikipedia's sociotechnical system and potential for collective intelligence, as well as the historical development of the project's technical infrastructure and the state of its technology-assisted collaboration. A mainly qualitative multi-method research approach was employed, including document analysis, semi-structured interviewing, and social network analysis. A plethora of documents were carefully selected and examined to explore how and why decisions were made, policies implemented, and technologies adopted on the site. Additionally, 45 interviews were conducted with members of Wikipedia's technical community to understand the relationships between social and technical aspects of the project and the motivations of programmers who contribute automated tools. Finally, social network measures and visualizations were used to interrogate notions of collaboration and make more transparent the centrality of technology to the content creation process. The study revealed that Wikipedia's technical development has been shaped by the dueling ideologies of the open-source software movement and postindustrial capitalism. Its sociotechnical system features the complex collaboration of human contributors, automated programs, social bureaucracy, and technical protocol, each of which conditions the existence and meaning of the others.

This paper describes JXTA (short for ""juxtapose"") in general and focuses on its applicability, for mobile-networked systems. Since mobile devices like PDAs, mobile phones, or laptop computers are much more likely to interoperate with each other in the absence of a coordinating authority such as a server there is an obvious need for a technology above the hardware abstraction level of IrDA and Bluetooth. JXTA enables mobile devices running on various platforms not only to share data with each other, but also to use functions of their respective peers. A general overview of the JXTA specification, the corresponding protocols, and mobile peer-to-peer aspects is presented. Furthermore, the current status of an open source JXTA implementation for Java is outlined This paper analyzes to what extent mobile devices are suitable for a peer-to-peer approach and how this approach can be realized with JXTA. To emphasize the practical impacts of a peer-to-peer approach some applications are described, which are based on the authors' current projects. This includes a hospital scenario, as well as an example for a distributed electronic patient health record. These examples are helpful, because they include security, data protection, wireless and mobile technology, and reliability.",,Peer to peer computing;Personal digital assistants;Distributed computing;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Portable computers;Hardware;Bluetooth;Protocols;Java,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To get more secure service and to get protection against Bot activity, the legitimate users switched their activity from Normal web browser to low latency anonymous communication such as Tor Browser. The Traffic monitoring in Tor Network is difficult as the packets are traveling from source to destination in an encrypted fashion and the Tor network hides its identity from destination. But lately, even the illegitimate users such as attackers/criminals started their activity on the Tor browser. The secured Tor network makes the detection of Botnet more difficult. The existing tools for botnet detection became inefficient against Tor-based bots because of the features of the Tor browser. As the Tor Browser is highly secure and because of the ethical issues, doing practical experiments on it is not advisable which could affect the performance and functionality of the Tor browser. It may also affect the endanger users in situations where the failure of Tor's anonymity has severe consequences. So, in the proposed research work, Private Tor Networks (PTN) on physical or virtual machines with dedicated resources have been created along with Trusted Middle Node.

Hence, educational systems and learning processes across the world are on the cusp of a major digital transformation. This paper seeks to explore the concept of an artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) in the context of computer education in primary and secondary schools. One of the components of an ITS is a learning assistant, which can enable students to seek assistance as and when they need, wherever they are. As part of this research, a pilot prototype chatbot was developed, to serve as a learning assistant for the subject Scratch (Scratch is a graphical utility used to teach school children the concepts of programming). By the use of an open source natural language understanding (NLU) or NLP library, and a slack-based UI, student queries were input to the chatbot, to get the sought explanation as the answer. Through a two-stage testing process, the chat-bot's NLP extraction and information retrieval performance were evaluated. The testing results showed that the ontology modelling for such a learning assistant was done relatively accurately, and shows its potential to be pursued as a cloud-based solution in future. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm grounded in game theory that is guaranteed to converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium. However, PSRO requires training a reinforcement learning policy at each iteration, making it too slow for large games. We show through counterexamples and experiments that DCH and Rectified PSRO, two existing approaches to scaling up PSRO, fail to converge even in small games. We introduce Pipeline PSRO (P2SRO), the first scalable PSRO-based method for finding approximate Nash equilibria in large zero-sum imperfect-information games. P2SRO is able to parallelize PSRO with convergence guarantees by maintaining a hierarchical pipeline of reinforcement learning workers, each training against the policies generated by lower levels in the hierarchy. We show that unlike existing methods, P2SRO converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium, and does so faster as the number of parallel workers increases, across a variety of imperfect information games. We also introduce an open-source environment for Barrage Stratego, a variant of Stratego with an approximate game tree complexity of 1050. P2SRO is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on Barrage Stratego and beats all existing bots.

This approach could represent a breakthrough in the mobile forensics, since the developed tool could replace the plethora of the hardware tools currently used. In this paper, firstly, we will summarize the current seizure methodology and its related problems when applied to the mobile device scenario.

Those visual contents have become the primary sources for online advertising. Conventional advertising treats multimedia advertising as general text advertising by displaying advertisements either relevant to the queries or the Web pages, without considering the potential advantages which could be brought by media contents. In this paper, we summarize the trend of Internet multimedia advertising and conduct a broad survey on the methodologies for advertising which are driven by the rich contents of images and videos. We discuss three key problems in a generic multimedia advertising framework. These problems are: contextual relevance that determines the selection of relevant advertisements, contextual intrusiveness which is the key to detect appropriate ad insertion positions within an image or video, and insertion optimization that achieves the best association between the advertisements and insertion positions so that the effectiveness of advertising can be maximized in terms of both contextual relevance and contextual intrusiveness. We show recently developed MediaSense which consists of image, video, and game advertising as an exemplary application of contextual multimedia advertising. In the MediaSense, the most contextually relevant ads are embedded at the most appropriate positions within images or videos. To this end, techniques in computer vision, multimedia retrieval, and computer human interaction are leveraged. We also envision that the next trend of multimedia advertising would be game-like advertising which is more impressionative and thus can promote advertising in an interactive, as well as more compelling and effective way.

A new era of cyber criminals are on the move. Real armies of robots (bots) swarm the internet perpetrating precise, objective and coordinated attacks on individuals and organizations. Many of these bots are now coordinated by real cybercrime organizations in an almost open-source driven development, which results in the proliferation of many bot variants with refined capabilities and increased detection complexity. Economical and reputation damages are difficult to quantify but the scale is widening. It's up to one's own imagination to figure out how much was lost in April of 2007 when Estonia suffered the well known distributed attack on its internet countrywide infrastructure. Among the techniques available to mitigate this threat, botnet detection emerges as a relevant solution. This technology has also evolved in recent years but it is still far from a definitive solution. New techniques, constantly appearing, in areas such as host infection, deployment, maintenance, control and dissimulation of bots are constantly changing the detection vectors thought and developed. In that way, research and implementation of anomaly-based botnet detection systems is fundamental to pinpoint and track the continuously changing botnets and clones, which are impossible to identify by simple signature-based systems. This paper presents the studies and tests made to define an effective set of traffic parameters capable of modeling both normal and abnormal activity of networks, focusing in botnet activity detection through behavior, numerical and heuristic modeling. Different types of botnets (IRC, P2P, HTTP, fast-flux among others) are initially analyzed followed by the study of some existing detection techniques and tools like Honeynet, Botsniffer and Botminner. Following this initial study, numerical and heuristic aspects of both normal and bot traffic are investigated. Finally, a set of traffic parameters is proposed aiming fast and precise botnet detection, with low false positive rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bobble-Bot is a modern example of the classic inverted pendulum problem that is commonly covered in control theory. It is a controls problem that requires a real-time controller to maintain stability.

The focus has turned to adding more humanlike characteristics into computer game agents. Machine learning techniques are scarcely being used in games, although they do offer powerful means for creating humanlike behaviors in agents. The first person shooter (FPS), Quake 2, is an open source game that offers a multi-agent environment in which to create game agents (bots). The work described in this paper seeks to combine neural networks with a modeling paradigm known as context based reasoning (CxBR) to create a contextual game observation (CONGO) system that produces humanlike Quake 2 bots. A default level of intelligence is instilled into the bots through contextual scripts to prevent the bot from being trained to be completely useless. The results show that the humanness and entertainment value as compared to a traditional scripted bot have improved, although, CONGO bots usually ranked only slightly above a novice skill level. Overall, CONGO offers the gaming community a mode of game play that has promising entertainment value. Copyright © 2009, Assocation for the Advancement of ArtdicaI Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

A CAPTCHA is challenge-response test placed within web forms to determine whether the user is human. Unfortunately, algorithms capable of solving image based CAPTCHAs can be used to create spam accounts and design malicious denial of service (DoS) attacks, causing financial and social damage. The problem of defeating digital image CAPTCHAs is thus twofold. On the one hand, it is an important problem in artificial intelligence and image processing. On the other hand, publicly available CAPTCHAs that are not tested against state of the art machine recognition algorithms may make the systems vulnerable to attack by software bots. This paper considers a very important subclass of text CAPTCHAs, those characterized by salt and pepper noise combined with line (curve) noise. Thus far, attacks on CAPTCHAs with this type of noise have used relatively simple image processing methods with some success, but state-of-the-art segmentation methods have not been fully exploited. In this paper, we propose and benchmark two strong segmentation methods. The first method is a modification of a multiple quadratic snake proposed for road extraction from satellite images. The second competing method is a boundary tracing routine available in the OpenCV open source library. A first numerical experiment indicates excellent accuracy for both methods. A second experiment on human recognition shows that the CAPTCHAs used in the study are already near the threshold of being too hard for humans. Finally, a third numerical experiment presents a more difficult set of CAPTCHAs with the addition of anti-binarization methods. The snake-based method is shown to be more resilient to anti-binarization schemes than boundary tracing and state-of-the art projection-based attacks on CAPTCHAs. Since CAPTCHAs corrupted by small line noise are shown to be difficult for humans and relatively easy for our algorithm, CAPTCHA designers should introduce more challenging distortions into their CAPTCHAs, lest the security of systems based on them be compromised.",,"CAPTCHA, OCR, GVF snake, OpenCV, Segmentation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A HIP, or Human Interactive Proofs, is a human authentication mechanism that generates and grades tests to determine whether the user is a human or a malicious computer program. Unfortunately, the existing HIPs tried to maximize the difficulty for automated programs to pass tests by increasing distortion or noise. Consequently, it has also become difficult for potential users too. So there is a tradeoff between the usability and robustness in designing HIP tests. In our proposed technique we tried to balance the readability and security by adding contextual information in the form of natural conversation without reducing the distortion and noise.

Offers act as a mechanism in which resource providers expose their interest in executing an entire BoT or only part of it without revealing their load and total computing power. We also evaluate the amount of information resource providers need to expose to the metascheduler and its impact on the scheduling. Our main findings are: (i) offer-based scheduling produces less delay for jobs that cannot meet deadlines in comparison to scheduling based on load availability (i.e. free time slots); thus it is possible to keep providers' load private when scheduling multi-site BoTs; and (ii) if providers publish their total computing power they can have more local jobs meeting deadlines.",,Processor scheduling;Computer applications;Job shop scheduling;Grid computing;Cloud computing;Application software;Information resources;Delay;Biological system modeling;Message passing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most used techniques for requirements extraction is the interview. Initiatives to support the training and technical training of computing students in this area are being proposed, such as the development of support mechanisms. These initiatives are proposed by the fact that computing students are graduating with limited practical knowledge in requirements extraction. In parallel, chatterbots have been investigated as tools with the capacity to support the training of students from different areas of knowledge, since the main characteristic is verbal conversational behavior. In medicine, for example, they can take on the role of a sick patient to train students to extract information about the patient's symptoms. One subject that has been explored in the context of educational chatterbots is context awareness, so that the chatterbot can present the right information for the right user. These surveys start from the premise that not every student has the same knowledge as their peers on the subject. Thus, in this research work in full paper we describe a chatterbot that offers support to Software Engineering Education, focusing mainly on the requirements extraction, which assumes the role of a stakeholder. A prototype of a chatterbot that is sensitive to student's context is presented, as well as preliminary results on the impact of this support mechanism in Software Engineering Education.",,Software;Software engineering;Training;Knowledge based systems;Interviews;Knowledge engineering;Conversational Systems;Requirements Engineering Education;Software Development Process;Ubiquitous Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed concept is based on a distributed network intrusion detection system (D-NIDS) integrated as a pump-in-the-stack process, based on a simplified open source network stack (light weight IP-lwIP). The small process-footprint (multi or single threaded) makes this solution suitable for all platforms and operating systems. Thus, embedded systems as well as high performance PCs or workstations may run this service without operating expense. The proposed solution differs from other solutions by a simple installation process-since no interactions are existing between the host- and the NIDS-stack- and the ability to run applications on top of the IDS (e.g. alluring-systems or sandbox systems). But the main idea is to take advantage of a mechanism known as ""state-transition intrusion detection"" and the integration of this mechanism into the network stack. The usage of state-transition based signatures can reduce large database entries and allows the reuse of already existing network stacks. Due to small database entries, this approach is highly scalable and can be a proper solution for small devices, PDAs, and embedded systems.",,Intrusion detection;Embedded system;Operating systems;Databases;Information processing;Communications technology;Personal communication networks;Workstations;Lakes;Personal digital assistants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work is the first demonstration of energetically autonomy in a microbial fuel cell (MFC)-powered, swimming robot taking energy from it's surrounding, aqueous environment. In contrast to previous work using stacked MFC power sources, the Row-bot employs a single microbial fuel cell as an artificial stomach and uses commercially available voltage step-up hardware to produce usable voltages. The energy generated exceeds the energy requirement to complete the mechanical actuation needed to refuel.

This can be attributed to the availability of better hardware and competent software. The processing capacity available has grown exponentially in the last decade. This has contributed to the creation of better chatbots through the years. More effort is required to build a model of this kind. The lack of open source chatbots that can be readily incorporated into specific fields is a concern. Parallel technologies have open-source alternatives for various possibilities. It is important for the field to have similar resources. So, that future effort can be directed towards better performance and mechanisms. We focused on creating a chatbot using a combination of rule-based approaches and neural networks in Green cloud. This helped us to create a chatbot that can also improve with time. It helped to reduce latencies involved in standard approaches, and also helps in quick classification of queries. This work also analysed the possibility of creating open-domain response generators of open-world nature. A successful model of this kind will help in further development of chatbots with specialized features and better responses. © 2020 the Author(s). All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today's social expectation of always staying connected and the need for an increase in productivity are the reasons for the increase in smartphone usage. One of the leaders of the smartphone evolution is Google's Android Operating System (OS). The openness of the design and the ease of customizing are the aspects that are placing Android ahead of the other smartphone OSs. Such popularity has not only led to an increase in Android usage but also to the rise of Android malware. Although such malware is not having a significant impact on the popularity of Android smartphones, it is however creating new possibilities for threats. One such threat is the impact of botnets on Android smartphones. Recently, malware has surfaced that revealed specific characteristics relating to traditional botnet activities. Malware such as Geinimi, Pjapps, DroidDream, and RootSmart all display traditional botnet functionalities. These malicious applications show that Android botnets is a reality. From a security perspective it is important to understand the underlying structure of an Android botnet. This paper evaluates Android malware with the purpose of identifying specific trends and characteristics relating to botnet behaviour. The botnet trends and characteristics are detected by a comprehensive literature study of well-known Android malware applications. The identified characteristics are then further explored in terms of the Android Botnet Development Model and the Android Botnet Discovery Process. The common identified trends and characteristics aid the understanding of Android botnet activities as well as the possible discovery of an Android bot.",,Androids;Humanoid robots;Smart phones;Malware;Market research;Servers;Android;botnet;malware;application;trends;characteristics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is today still a great experience to view high quality large format images with depth perception, exceptionally of virtual objects like reconstructions of the past or building projects. High quality presentation of computer graphics is provided by projection onto a transparent screen surface from behind. Image separation can be easily performed by polarisation filters in front of the projection lenses. It is necessary that the beholders carry polarized glasses. Interactive viewing in this context means, that the observer is able to select image pairs from the database, can zoom in and out, select the display details and sets the zero parallax to an arbitrary position. The selection must be simultaneously transferred to the second image of the stereoscopic pair. While each data projector is driven by its own computer, a PDA (personal digital assistant) is recommended to receive the instructions from the presenter or viewer. That network configuration requires amongst other software tools Bluetooth, to connect the PDA to a local computer network, and ActiveSync, to hold a continuous connection between the PDA and the host computer. Furthermore a Web server with PHP (hypertext pre processor) extension is running. Web browsers are acting as clients on both computers and the PDA as well. The challenge is now to write an application software that provides an interface on the PDA to set the adjustments and pushes the image information to the graphic cards of the host and the slave computer. To minimize the effort in software development, open source software components are largely applied to this system. We take advantages from Mozilla Firefox Web browser and Apache Web server. This paper introduces the application of AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) Web scripting in connectivity with PHP and delineates the infrastructure of network components connected to a working presentation environment, that serves a screen surface of about 100 inch diagonal.

They differed in training sets. The second step presents a join of DNN based chat with IBM Watson services (Speech-To-Text, Text-To-Speach). Originally, IBM Watson provides these services for limited number of languages. Slovak language is not included, too. Google cloud services fill this gap quite in good manner. This led to replacement of the IBM Watson services by the Google services. Finally, the chatbot is able to communicate in multiple languages, Slovak language including.

Our focus is on diets where certain foods must either be restricted (e.g., metabolic diseases), avoided (e.g., food intolerance or allergies), or preferably consumed for medical reasons. However, our framework can be used to manage other diets (e.g., vegan) as well. The system is based on the use of a hand-held multimedia device such as a PDA or mobile telephone to analyze and/or disambiguate the content of foods offered on restaurant menus and interpret them in the context of specific diets. The system also provides the option to communicate diet-related instructions or information to a local person (e.g., a waiter) as well as obtain clarifications through dialogue. All computations are performed within the device and do not require a network connection. Real-time text translation is a challenge. We address this challenge with a light-weight, context-specific machine translation method. This method builds on a modification of existing open source Machine Translation (MT) software to obtain a fast and accurate translation. In particular, we describe a method we call n-gram consolidation that joins words in a language pair and increases the accuracy of the translation. We developed and implemented this system on the iPod Touch for English speakers traveling in Spain. Our tests indicate that our translation method yields the correct translation more often than general purpose translation engines such as Google Translate, and does so almost instantaneously.

DESIGN: Prospective intervention pilot study. SETTING: Vancouver, BC, and surrounding area. PARTICIPANTS: Eight general practitioners. INTERVENTIONS: Each physician used Palm Prevention for five preventive measures during routine preventive health visits with 10 patients (n = 80). Charts of consenting patients were reviewed for documentation of recommended maneuvers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of adherence to five evidence-based guidelines selected from the Canadian and American task forces on preventive care and incorporated into Palm Prevention. RESULTS: Intervention and control physicians were similar in their familiarity with and use of PDAs, and they recruited similar patients for the study. Intervention and control groups had similar rates of screening for hypertension. Intervention improved adherence to the remaining four guidelines: cervical cancer screening increased 22% (only absolute increases are reported); hyperlipidemia screening increased 30%; colorectal cancer screening increased 27%; and prophylaxis with acetylsalicylic acid in high-risk patients increased 38%. Participants were surveyed after the study; all reported that they found the software helpful and would continue using Palm Prevention. Usage statistics showed that study participants used the tool outside the trial: users entered between 28 and 68 unique patients into the program during the 2-month intervention. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests PDAs are useful in improving preventive care and facilitating translation of knowledge into practice.

The exact goal is typically not known from the beginning, and throughout all design stages, new decisions are made - similarly to other design industries [1]. As a result, the design must adapt and subsequent consequences follow. With working methods being predominantly document-centric, highly interrelated and rapidly changing design data in a complex network of decisions, requirements and product specifications is primarily captured in static documents. In this paper, we consider a purely data-driven approach based on semantic web technologies and an earlier proposed Ontology for Property Management (OPM). The main contribution of this work consists of extensions for OPM to account for new competency questions including the description of property reliability and the reasoning logic behind derived properties. The secondary contribution is the specification of a homogeneous way to generate parametric queries for managing an OPM-compliant AEC Knowledge Graph (AEC-KG). A software library for operating an OPM-compliant AEC-KG is further presented in the form of an OPM Query Generator (OPM-QG). The library generates SPARQL 1.1 queries to query and manipulate construction project Knowledge Graphs represented using OPM. The OPM ontology aligns with latest developments in the W3C Community Group on Linked Building Data and suggests an approach to working with design data in a distributed environment using separate graphs for explicit facts and for materialised, deduced data. Finally, we evaluate the suggested approach using an open-source software artefact developed using OPM and OPM-QG, demonstrated online with an actual building Knowledge Graph. The particular design task evaluated is performing heat loss calculations for spaces of a future building using an AEC-KG described using domain- and project specific extensions of the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) in combination with OPM. With this work, we demonstrate how a typical engineering task can be accomplished and managed in an evolving design environment, thereby providing the engineers with insights to support decision making as changes occur. The application uses a strict division between the client viewer and the actual data model holding design logic, and can easily be extended to support other design tasks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While developers may document the most important features modification or bugs fixing, recent empirical studies show that the documentation of quality improvements and/or refactoring is often omitted or not accurately described. However, the automated or semi-automated documentation of refactorings has not been yet explored despite the extensive work on the remaining steps of refactoring including the detection, prioritization and recommendation. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated refactoring documentation bot that helps developers to interactively check and validate the documentation of the refactorings and/or quality improvements at the file level for each opened pull-request before being reviewed or merged to the master. The bot starts by checking the pullrequest if there are significant quality changes and refactorings at the file level and whether they are documented by the developer. Then, it checks the validity of the developers description of the refactorings, if any. Based on that analysis, the documentation bot will recommend a message to document the refactorings, their locations and the quality improvement for that pull-request when missing information is found. Then, the developer can modify his pull request description by interacting with the bot to accept/modify/reject part of the proposed documentation. Since refactoring do not happen in isolation most of the time, the bot is documenting the impact of a sequence of refactorings, in a pull-request, on quality and not each refactoring in isolation. We conducted a human survey with 14 active developers to manually evaluate the relevance and the correctness of our tool on different pull requests of 5 open source projects and one industrial system. The results show that the participants found that our bot facilitates the documentation of their quality-related changes and refactorings.",,Documentation;Measurement;Feature extraction;Tools;Software;Couplings;Security;Intelligent bot;refactoring;documentation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate to what extent chatbots are suitable for collaborative modelling, we conducted an experimental study with 54 participants, to evaluate the usability of a modelling chatbot called SOCIO, comparing it with the on-line tool Creately. We employed a within-subjects cross-over design of 2 sequences and 2 periods. Usability was determined by attributes of efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction and quality of the results.

A large number of human-generated network activities can emulate traffic from real network users. Deploying and producing a single activity from an individual user is simple, but emulating and automating it from multiple users with a wide range of activities is challenging. We designed a containerized human agent (i.e., bot) to generate a single activity. Thus, a large number of bots can be deployed and controlled by a single orchestration system. Due to the complexity and wide-range usage of container orchestration systems, we need to develop a simpler system that leverages widely-used open-source container orchestrator. So, researchers and scientists can easily use it to define and execute activity requirements with a few command lines or a single specification file. This work shows the implementation of an orchestration system with several unique bots and their deployment in a production testbed environment.

These pedagogical patterns belong to e-Tutors' know-how and experience and their resolution are frequently a matter of activating routine processes or giving pre-factored answers; nevertheless statistical data indicates that these issues consume a considerable slice of tutors' time. While a portion of the scientific community is still devoting much effort in developing artificial tutoring systems - by deploying AI/MAS-enabled technologies - the solution being investigated by our team focuses on enhancing already-available, open source LMS by implementing a general-purpose tracking and monitoring toolkit able to support e-Tutors in recognizing and dealing with pedagogical patterns stored into a decentralised Knowledge Base. The system architecture is designed to house multiple platforms (only one adapter interface needs to be written for each LMS) and is able to perform real-time, as well as scheduled, data collection by means of Jade-based agents and schedulers. Information obtained from the processed data is then returned to the platform via web services and specific interfaces (instant messaging chatbot). The first deployed prototype is currently being experimented in adult higher education learning paths and is able to track student activity, forum readings and writings and offers a basic chat-based help interface. Our aim is to turn a standard LMS into a knowledge aggregator where information about its users, its contents and interactions between the two can be mined via Knowledge Services; resulting data could then be used to refine users' and groups' profiles, to monitor learners' deviance from expected learning path, and ultimately to adjust the applied pedagogical model.

The presented research describes the experimentation of a Open Source, LMS enhanced with elements of AI aiming at supporting online teachers' and tutors' work by using a KB specific to relational and pedagogical aspects, not connected to a specific subject matter. Such implementation needs to be provided of an authoring tool easily and readily usable by tutors and teachers of different subjects and with medium level IT training. Starting point of our investigation has been a preliminary analysis of machine-mediated, human-human interactions (MM-HHI) and communications by using the Teachers' thinking approach [4] [5] [6]. We considered messages exchanged between teachers/tutors and online students in three post-graduate, online courses running at the University of Macerata during 2008 - 2010 by the Faculty of Education. The study showed that about 30% of messages concerned structured information that could be straightforwardly retrieved by an artificial agent; almost all remaining messages were instead deeply bound to student's learning path or required a significant input by the teacher/tutor, while the residual part of messages could - to some extents - be delegated to an intelligent agent having access to students' tracking data in order to display visual information to users or trigger alarms to tutors. The investigation carried out prompted us for the deployment of an Open Source chat-bot system that would retrieve information already coded into the courses or originated by students through the analysis of their activity logs; the chat-bot agent uses this structured information in order to answer students' most common questions hence relieving teachers and tutors from doing this repetitive task.

Not only has DL profoundly affected the healthcare industry it has also influenced global businesses. Within a span of very few years, advances such as self-driving cars, robots performing jobs that are hazardous to human, and chat bots talking with human operators have proved that DL has already made large impact on our lives. The open source nature of DL and decreasing prices of computer hardware will further propel such changes. In healthcare, the potential is immense due to the need to automate the processes and evolve error free paradigms. The sheer quantum of DL publications in healthcare has surpassed other domains growing at a very fast pace, particular in radiology. It is therefore imperative for the radiologists to learn about DL and how it differs from other approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The next generation of radiology will see a significant role of DL and will likely serve as the base for augmented radiology (AR). Better clinical judgement by AR will help in improving the quality of life and help in life saving decisions, while lowering healthcare costs. A comprehensive review of DL as well as its implications upon the healthcare is presented in this review. We had analysed 150 articles of DL in healthcare domain from PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE EXPLORE focused in medical imagery only. We have further examined the ethic, moral and legal issues surrounding the use of DL in medical imaging. © 2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring. Research challenges for the proposed framework are discussed and a research roadmap is presented.",,MDE;Models;NLP;ModBud;Bots;Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore, an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations, particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers.

To address this challenge, we aim to develop an approach to extract domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language by combining rules based on natural language processing with machine learning. As a first step, we report on an automated and tool-supported approach with an accuracy of extracted domain models higher than existing approaches. In addition, the approach generates trace links for each model element of a domain model. The trace links enable novice modellers to execute queries on the extracted domain models to gain insights into the modelling decisions taken for improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, to evaluate our approach, we propose a novel comparison metric and discuss our experimental design.

At the same time, the success of privacy infrastructures such as Tor opened the door to illegal activities, including botnets, ransomware, and a marketplace for drugs and contraband. We contend that the next waves of botnets will extensively attempt to subvert privacy infrastructure and cryptographic mechanisms. In this work we propose to preemptively investigate the design and mitigation of such botnets. We first, introduce OnionBots, what we believe will be the next generation of resilient, stealthy botnets. OnionBots use privacy infrastructures for cyber attacks by completely decoupling their operation from the infected host IP address and by carrying traffic that does not leak information about its source, destination, and nature. Such bots live symbiotically within the privacy infrastructures to evade detection, measurement, scale estimation, observation, and in general all IP-based current mitigation techniques. Furthermore, we show that with an adequate self-healing network maintenance scheme, that is simple to implement, OnionBots can achieve a low diameter and a low degree and be robust to partitioning under node deletions. We develop a mitigation technique, called SOAP, that neutralizes the nodes of the basic OnionBots. In light of the potential of such botnets, we believe that the research community should proactively develop detection and mitigation methods to thwart OnionBots, potentially making adjustments to privacy infrastructure.",,Peer-to-peer computing;Servers;Privacy;IP networks;Relays;Cryptography;Maintenance engineering;botnet;Tor;self-healing network;cyber security;privacy infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As concluded by several empirical studies during the past 10 years, applying MBSE methodology is no more a question and we shall now wonder how to do it rather than if we should. One of the major criticisms of MBSE remains about the available tooling to apply its methodology. Multiple surveys show that the usability of tools and the lack of skills from the user are two key barriers that still slow down the spread of the MBSE approach. In the meantime, these surveys also highlight the difficulties software engineers often encounter during the modeling activity itself, regardless of the tool. Indeed, complex operations such as problem-to-model mapping, consistency checking or error identification are still often manually performed by humans. The recent advances in AIs introduced new software-based systems able to interact with their users to help them in their daily life. The purpose of this PhD is to investigate how such AIs (which we will call software assistants) could help software engineers to face the complexity of software modeling. Interactions between software assistants and users of MBSE tools will be the bulk of this work. We plan to implement software assistants and provide them an access to a high-quality knowledge repository on models that we will build to study these interactions. Based on these studies, we hope to contribute laying the foundations of interactions with software assistants. The end result will feature a knowledge repository and a Software Assistant acting together to help users modeling by catering for new ideas, recommendations and help. This work will also provide frameworks to create knowledge repositories and IDE-embedded software assistants.",,Model-Driven Engineering;Modeling tools;Digital Assistants;Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This technological context imposes new challenges in user interface software engineering, as it must run on different computing platforms accommodating the capabilities of various devices and the different contexts of use. Challenges are triggered also because of the universal access requirements for a diversity of users. The existing approaches of designing a single user interface using one computing platform do not adequately address the challenges of diversity, cross-platform consistency, universal accessibility and integration. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a new integrative framework for modeling, designing and evaluating multi-device user interfaces for the emerging generation of interactive systems. This paper begins by describing a set of constraints and characteristics intrinsic to multi-device user interfaces, and then by examining the impacts of these constraints on the specification, design and validation processes. Then, it discusses the research opportunities in important topics relevant to multi-device user interface development, including task and model-based, pattern-driven and device-independent development. We will highlight how research in these topics can contribute to the emergence of an integrative framework for Multiple-User Interface design and validation. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Nowadays, Web robots are frequently used for performing malicious (spamming and spying, etc.) activities on the internet because of their camouflage behavior. In web server logs it is difficult to identify the HTTP requests generated by these automated traverses due to circumventing identity. Unsupervised clustering methods may be useful for categorizing the HTTP user sessions into web robot and human sessions. In this paper, three clustering algorithms such as clustering large application (CLARA), ordering points to identify clustering (OPTICS) and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchy (BIRCH) are used to cluster the session data. The used clustering algorithms are considered from different categories such as Partition-Based, density-based and hierarchy-based respectively. The used algorithms are implemented in ELKI and JBIRCH open source libraries and applied on publicly available user session data. The comparative clustering performance of algorithms is done using cluster validity measures including Rand Index, Jaccard Index, and F-measure. The effective time taken by each measure for clustering web robot sessions and distinguishing from other three classes is also measured.",,Clustering algorithms;Bot (Internet);Partitioning algorithms;Optics;Indexes;Robots;Approximation algorithms;Web robots;HTTP sessions;weblogs;clustering;CLARA;BIRCH;OPTICS;validity measures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, different supervised techniques are used to extract sentiment from texts which require large manually labeled datasets that are expensive and time consuming to build. Moreover, such datasets should cover vocabularies and patterns of use of different contexts. Additionally, the efficiency of supervised methods trained on a well-written texts can dramatically decrease on users' texts from social media due to typos, slang, short length of sentences.

The ability to explore a genetic design space by building extensive libraries of DNA constructs is essential for creating programmed biological systems. With multiple DNA assembly methods and standards adopted in the Synthetic Biology community, automation of the DNA assembly process is now receiving serious attention. Automation will enable larger builds using less researcher time, while increasing the accessible design space. However, these benefits currently incur high costs for both equipment and consumables. Here, we address this limitation by introducing low-cost DNA assembly with BASIC on OpenTrons (DNA-BOT). For this purpose, we developed an open-source software package and demonstrated the performance of DNA-BOT by simultaneously assembling 88 constructs composed of 10 genetic parts, evaluating the promoter, ribosome binding site and gene order design space for a three-gene operon. All 88 constructs were assembled with high accuracy, at a consumables cost of $1.50-$5.50 per construct. This illustrates the efficiency, accuracy and affordability of DNA-BOT, making it accessible for most labs and democratizing automated DNA assembly. © The Author(s) 2020.

The capacity of the human memory does not scale to the ever larger number of ever stronger passwords needed for these services. Single sign-on (SSO) systems help users cope with password fatigue, but SSO systems still mostly lack support for strong two-factor authentication. At the same time, the users have adopted mobile phones as personal digital assistants that are used both for accessing online services and for managing personal information. The phones increasingly include mobile trusted computing technology that can be used for hardware-based storage of user credentials. Thus, it is rather obvious that the mobile phones should be used as authentication tokens for critical online services. In this paper, we show that existing open-source software platforms and commonly available mobile devices can be used to implement strong authentication for an SSO system. We use the Internet-enabled mobile phone as a secure token in a federated single sign-on environment. More specifically, we extend the Shibboleth SSO identity provider and build an authentication client based on a Nokia hardware security module. Our system design is modular, and both the SSO solution and the hardware-based security module in the phone can be replaced with other similar technologies. In comparison to most commercially available strong authentication services, our system is open in the sense that it does not depend on a specific credential issuer or identity provider. Thus, it can be deployed by any organization without signing contracts with or paying fees to a third party. No modifications need to be made to the client web browser or to the online service providers. We conclude that it is possible to implement strong personal authentication for an open-source SSO system with low start-up and operating costs and gradual deployment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These benefits are particularly important in fields in which students must master large amounts of information and effectively operationalize it, as in medicine and dentistry. While online learning platforms have the potential to provide students with active learning without taxing scarce faculty resources, a recognized challenge in producing such systems is the engineering of the domain knowledge needed for engaging interaction. In this paper we address this problem by developing an open-source chatbot-based tutoring system trained on dental textbooks in the area of endodontics, one of the most challenging areas of dentistry. Dental TutorBot is built using Rasa for modular training purposes. It asks short questions from students and evaluates their answers. If the student cannot answer a question, the system provides a hint, rather than immediately giving the student the answer. In this way, it coaches the student to find the answer and thus helps them to understand the connections between concepts while creating a more intellectually stimulating learning experience.

This evolution demands more powerful, helpful, and aware QA systems, able to provide high-quality answers to a wide range of questions. A way to meet this level of requirement is to combine multiple restricted domain QAs to yield a high-quality open domain QA. This system can use a routing mechanism based on a hierarchical question domain classifier to select the proper restricted QA system to answer the user's question. However, the creation and maintenance of a large and robust dataset of labeled questions required to train this mechanism are impractical to be done by hand. For tackling this problem, in this study, we present a strategy for automatically generating labeled datasets of questions from the same documents used as the sources of information demanded by the QA systems. To validate the proposed approach, we created a large dataset and applied it to train a hierarchical question domain classifier. Next, we evaluated the performance of this classifier using human-elaborated and labeled questions. The results indicated that the questions automatically created have high quality and thus they can be safely used in real-world applications.",,Sports;Art;Training;Routing;Personal digital assistants;Portals;Databases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Social bots aim to engage user with unstructured human conversations. These dialogue agents don't have fixed aim to complete and focus more on carrying out open domain conversations. For example ALIZA, Microsoft XiaoIce etcOn the other hand, Task oriented dialogue agents help user to accomplish certain tasks in specific domains like Restaurant booking, Flight reservation, customer support etc. These are popularly used in controlling home appliances and carrying out simple tasks by users in day to day life. Siri, Alexa, Google Mini, Cortana are task oriented dialogue agents. There is increasing interest in building task completion dialogue agents that span over multiple sub-domains to accomplish a complex user goal.With the increasing acceptance of Dialogue Agents, there is need of high-quality, large-scale dialogue datasets for better performance of task oriented dialogue agent in changing environment. Neural approaches are applied to design intelligent dialogue agents frequently which require very large datasets. However, there are following challenges while building intelligent task completion dialogue systems. Firstly, there are a lot of datasets available for chit-chat bots but they are not directly relevant to task oriented systems. Secondly, to scale out the system to new domains with limited in-domain data.In this paper, we studied different data collection methods, important characteristics of dialogue datasets and their potential uses. This paper presents a survey of publicly available datasets and their applicability for designing modern task - oriented dialogue agents.",,Home appliances;Mechatronics;Virtual assistants;Buildings;Internet;Task analysis;Information technology;Conversational AI;Dialogue Systems;Corpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that a flexible combination of animation approaches may be needed to satisfy these needs. In this paper we present SmartBody, an open source modular framework for animating ECAs in real time, based on the notion of hierarchically connected animation controllers. Controllers in SmartBody can employ arbitrary animation algorithms such as keyframe interpolation, motion capture or procedural animation. Controllers can also schedule or combine other controllers. We discuss our architecture in detail, including how we incorporate traditional approaches, and develop the notion of a controller as a reactive module within a generic framework, for realizing modular animation control. To illustrate the versatility of the architecture, we also discuss a range of applications that have used SmartBody success-fully.

Go’s high branching factor makes traditional search techniques ineffective, even on leading-edge hardware, and Go’s evaluation function could change drastically with one stone change. Recent works [Maddison et al. (2015); Clark & Storkey (2015)] show that search is not strictly necessary for machine Go players. A pure pattern-matching approach, based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that predicts the next move, can perform as well as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based open source Go engines such as Pachi [Baudis & Gailly (2012)] if its search budget is limited. We extend this idea in our bot named darkforest, which relies on a DCNN designed for long-term predictions. Darkforest substantially improves the win rate for pattern-matching approaches against MCTS-based approaches, even with looser search budgets. Against human players, the newest versions, darkfores2, achieve a stable 3d level on KGS Go Server as a ranked bot, a substantial improvement upon the estimated 4k-5k ranks for DCNN reported in Clark & Storkey (2015) based on games against other machine players. Adding MCTS to darkfores2 creates a much stronger player named darkfmcts3: with 5000 rollouts, it beats Pachi with 10k rollouts in all 250 games; with 75k rollouts it achieves a stable 5d level in KGS server, on par with state-of-the-art Go AIs (e.g., Zen, DolBaram, CrazyStone) except for AlphaGo [Silver et al.

Using ELF, we implement a highly customizable real-time strategy (RTS) engine with three game environments (Mini-RTS, Capture the Flag and Tower Defense). Mini-RTS, as a miniature version of StarCraft, captures key game dynamics and runs at 40K frame-per-second (FPS) per core on a laptop. When coupled with modern reinforcement learning methods, the system can train a full-game bot against built-in AIs end-to-end in one day with 6 CPUs and 1 GPU. In addition, our platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication topologies, choices of RL methods, changes in game parameters, and can host existing C/C++-based game environments like ALE [4]. Using ELF, we thoroughly explore training parameters and show that a network with Leaky ReLU [17] and Batch Normalization [11] coupled with long-horizon training and progressive curriculum beats the rule-based built-in AI more than 70% of the time in the full game of Mini-RTS. Strong performance is also achieved on the other two games. In game replays, we show our agents learn interesting strategies.

This paper proposes the use of semantic Web techniques to automate the processing of networking meta-data in a hybrid internetwork, with the two-fold outcome of raising the degree of confidence in the internetwork and lowering its operating costs. By virtue of latching onto the semantic Web curve, a new breed of power tools - bots, compilers, browsers - will be delivering on the aforementioned outcomes, while fully leveraging COTS and open source building blocks. Furthermore, the investment in the semantic Web is thought to future proof a hybrid internetwork and readies it for times when service metrics other than connectivity (e.g., resiliency, protocol transparency, security etc.) will be evaluated end-to-end.

The open-source framework, spark-based distributed, fast and scalable nearest neighbor search (S-DFS-NNS) is proposed for profile-based fake account detection across large-scale online social networks. The proposed work performs an efficient parallel processing of the NN search problem. The performance of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search significantly degrades for huge data sets, because the job is computationally hard. The framework is fast and adaptable to expansive, large-scale situations. By using in-memory computation, the suspected users are identified based on the novel private feature. The Spark-DFS-NN search technique provides a substantial performance development over the nearest neighbor computation in large-scale networks. The proposed framework is evaluated using detection accuracy which is able to expose and block a large fraction of suspicious accounts during account creation.

An ""online"" offering of a course typically increases the faculty effort by a factor of four to six and, without costly broadband communications equipment and operating personnel, it is difficult for students to ask questions of the instructor or the instructor to poll or quiz the students. Without these features, much of what is called ""distance-learning"" today can be distilled to nothing more than watching recorded video and definitely not the desired ""learning community"" experience of the contemporary engineering classroom. Silicon Chalktrade is collaborative software designed to enhance the face-to-face experience, allow for and encourage participation of remote students, record the entire process, and make it available to students involved synchronously and asynchronously while eliminating, almost entirely, the additional staff and equipment overhead traditionally required.

The first stage detects anomalies by leveraging large deviations of an empirical distribution. We propose two approaches to create the empirical distribution: 1) a flow-based approach estimating the histogram of quantized flows and 2) a graph-based approach estimating the degree distribution of node interaction graphs, encompassing both Erdös-Rényi graphs and scale-free graphs. The second stage detects the bots using ideas from social network community detection in a graph that captures correlations of interactions among nodes over time. Community detection is performed by maximizing a modularity measure in this graph. The modularity maximization problem is nonconvex. We propose a convex relaxation, an effective randomization algorithm, and establish sharp bounds on the suboptimality gap.

Secondly, the user is freed from the time-consuming task of finding and negotiating with appropriate traders. Thirdly, it addresses the problem of limited and expensive connection time for mobile users: A trader can disconnect her mobile device from its server after launching a mobile agent.

Comparing the Interaction With Automatically and Manually Created Pull Requests",,,,June,6-10,2021,,,,2021 IEEE/ACM Third International Workshop on Bots in Software Engineering (BotSE),,,,,,,,,,,,"As a maintainer of an open source software project, you are usually happy about contributions in the form of pull requests that bring the project a step forward. Past studies have shown that when reviewing a pull request, not only its content is taken into account, but also, for example, the social characteristics of the contributor. Whether a contribution is accepted and how long this takes therefore depends not only on the content of the contribution. What we only have indications for so far, however, is that pull requests from bots may be prioritized lower, even if the bots are explicitly deployed by the development team and are considered useful. One goal of the bot research and development community is to design helpful bots to effectively support software development in a variety of ways. To get closer to this goal, in this GitHub mining study, we examine the measurable differences in how maintainers interact with manually created pull requests from humans compared to those created automatically by bots. About one third of all pull requests on GitHub currently come from bots. While pull requests from humans are accepted and merged in 72.53% of all cases, this applies to only 37.38% of bot pull requests. Furthermore, it takes significantly longer for a bot pull request to be interacted with and for it to be merged, even though they contain fewer changes on average than human pull requests. These results suggest that bots have yet to realize their full potential.",,Bot (Internet);Conferences;Data mining;Research and development;Open source software;Software development management;Software engineering;software bot;human-agent interaction;open source;pull request;github mining study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A chatbot is a brand-new conversational agent in the highspeed changing technology world. With the advance of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, chatbots are becoming more and more popular. A chatbot is the extension of human interface mediums such as the phone and social platforms. Similarly, Cryptocurrency is a new extension of digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. In the current digital exchanging world, investors and interested parties are eager to know more information about, and the capabilities of, this new type of currency. One of the potential paths to retrieve the info automatically and quickly is through a chatbot. We explored the open source python library, Chatterbot, to apply Itchat API (a WeChat interface) with the aim of building a robot chatting application, I&C Chat, on the topic of cryptocurrency. First, we collected question and answer pairs datasets from Quora websites. Furthermore, we also created API calls to query the real time quote for the top 25 cryptocurrencies. Then we used the collected data to train our chatbot and implemented a logic adapter to receive the price quote of cryptocurrencies based on the incoming question. The Itchat API method will return the best matched answer to the asking party automatically. The response time of different questions has been investigated. The results imply that this application is quite useful, feasible and beneficial to the digital currency world.",,Cryptocurrency;Google;Online banking;Facebook;Bit error rate;Real-time systems;Chatbot;Cryptocurrency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past ten years or so, primarily in response to the growing security threats and financial fraud, it has become necessary to accurately authenticate the identities of human beings using biometrics. For similar reasons, it may become essential to determine the identities of nonbiological entities. Trust and security issues associated with the large-scale deployment of military soldier-robots [55], robot museum guides [22], software office assistants [24], human like biped robots [67], office robots [5], domestic and industrial androids [93], [76], bots [85], robots with humanlike faces [60], virtual-world avatars [109], and thousands of other man-made entities require the development of methods for a decentralized, affordable, automatic, fast, secure, reliable, and accurate means of authenticating these artificial agents. The approach has to be decentralized to allow authority-free authentication important for open-source and collaborative societies. To address these concerns, we proposed [117], [120], [119], [38] the concept of artimetricsa field of study that identifies, classifies, and authenticates robots, software, and virtual reality agents.

The goal of this project is to explore the opportunity of filling this gap through developing and trial of a personal digital assistant (PDA) based data collection/entry system. It evaluated whether such a system could increase efficiency and reduce data transcription errors for public surveillance data collection in developing countries represented by Fiji. Methods: A generic PDA-based data collection software eSTEPS was developed. The software and the data collected using it directly interfaces with EpiData. A field trial was conducted to test the viability of public health surveillance data collection using eSTEPS. The design was a randomised, controlled trial with cross-over design. 120 participants recruited from the Fiji School of Medicine were randomly assigned to be interviewed by one of six interviewers in one of the two ways: (1) paper-based survey followed by PDA survey and (2) PDA survey followed by paper-based survey. Data quality was measured by error rates (logical range errors/inconsistencies, skip errors, missing values, date or time field errors and incorrect data type). Work flow and cost were evaluated in three stages of the survey process: (1) preparation of data collection instrument, (2) data collection and (3) data entry, validation and cleaning. User acceptance was also evaluated in the two groups of participants: (1) data collectors and (2) survey participants. Results: None of the errors presented in 20.8% of the paper questionnaires was found in the data set collected using PDA. Sixty-two percent of the participants perceived that the PDA-based questionnaire took less time to complete. Data entry, validation and cleaning for the PDA-based data collection from 120 participants took a total of 1.5 h, a 93.26% reduction of time from 20.5 h required using paper and pen. The cost is also significantly reduced with PDA-based protocol. Both data collectors and participants prefer to use PDA instead of paper for data collection. The trial results prove that eSTEPS is a feasible solution for public health surveillance data collection in the field. Several deficiencies of the software were also identified and would be addressed in the next version. Conclusion: eSTEPS offers the potential to meet the need for an effective mobile public health data collection tool for use in the field. The eSTEPS field trial proves that PDA was more efficient than paper for public health survey data collection. It also significantly reduced errors in data entry. The later benefit was derived from the software providing its users with the flexibility of building their own constraints to control the data type, range and logic of data entry. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aiming robot (aimbot) is a common cheating mechanism employed in this genre, it differs from many other common online bots in that there is a human operating alongside the bot, and thus the in-game data exhibit both human and bot-like behaviour. The aimbot users can aim much better than the average player. However, there are also a large number of highly skilled players who can aim much better than the average player, some of these players have in the past been banned from servers due to false accusations from their peers. Therefore, it would be interesting to find out if and where the honest player's and the bot user's behaviour differ. In this paper we investigate the difference between the aiming abilities of aimbot users and honest human players. We introduce two novel features and have conducted an experiment using a modified open source FPS game. Our data shows that there is significant difference between behaviours of honest players and aimbot users. We propose a voting scheme to improve aimbot detection in FPS based on distribution matching, and have achieved approximately 93% in both True positive and True negative rates with one of our features.",,Games;Weapons;Humans;Mice;Servers;Acceleration;Accuracy;Game Bots;First Person Shooters;Cheating Detection;Statistical Analysis;Distribution Comparison;Voting Scheme;Computer Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bot can recognize 381 intents, decides when to say I don’t know, and escalate escalation/uncertain questions to human operators. Our main novel contribution is the discussion about the uncertainty measure for BERT, where three different approaches are systematically compared with real problems. We investigated two uncertainty metrics, information entropy and variance of dropout sampling, in BERT, followed by mixed-integer programming to optimize decision thresholds. Another novel contribution is the usage of BERT as a language model in automatic spelling correction. Inputs with accidental spelling errors can significantly decrease intent classification performance. The proposed approach combines probabilities from masked language model and word edit distances to find the best corrections for misspelled words. The chatbot and the entire conversational AI system are developed using open-source tools and deployed within our company’s intranet. The proposed approach can be useful for industries seeking similar in-house solutions in their specific business domains.

Spam refers to the abuse of electronic messaging system by sending unrequested bulk messages randomly. Botnets are considered one of the main contributors to the sources of spam. Botnet refers to a group of software called bots. The function of these bots is to run on several compromised computers autonomously and automatically. Spamming causes illegal consuming of network resources in general and mail system in particular. The objective of this research is to detect the source of spam on the network by detecting the abnormal behaviors that reflect spamming activities. Behavioral-based Spam Detector (BSD) combines several behaviors of the spam bots at different stages including the behavior of spam preparation before the spam session when the spammers search for an open relay SMTP service to send e-mails through, and the behavior of spammers while connecting to the mail server. The proposed method monitors the network traffic for group malicious activities. The relationship between the host behaviors that trigger suspicion is used to find out if there are any Spam bots or Botnet members within the network. Detecting the abnormal behavior produced by the spam activities gives a high rate of suspicion on the existence of bots.",,Unsolicited electronic mail;Electronic mail;Filters;Postal services;Computer worms;Computer networks;Computer viruses;Internet;Detectors;Relays;SPAM;Botnet detection;Network threat detection;Network worm detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key issue for this out-of-order execution is that the occupancy latency of a physical rename register can be undesirably long due to many program execution-dependent factors that result in performance degradation. Such an issue becomes even more problematic in an SMT environment in which these registers are shared among concurrently running threads. Smartly managing this critical shared resource to ensure that slower threads do not block faster threads’ execution is essential to the advancement of SMT performance. In this paper, an actor–critic style reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to dynamically assigning an upper-bound (cap) of the rename registers any thread is allowed to use according to the threads’ real-time demand. In particular, a critic network projects the current Issue Queues (IQ) usage, register file usage, and the cap value to a reward; an actor network is trained to project the current IQ usage and register file usage to the optimal real-time cap value via ascending the instructions per cycle (IPC) gradient within the trajectory distribution. The proposed method differs from the state-of-the-art (Wang and Lin, 2018) as the cap for the rename registers for each thread is adjusted in real-time according to the policy and state transition from self-play. The proposed method shows an improvement in IPC up to 162.8% in a 4-threaded system, 154.8% in a 6-threaded system and up to 101.7% in an 8-threaded system.
